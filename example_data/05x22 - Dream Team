Oh, good. My hooker's here.  Hi.
Yes I was. Yes I was.
That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
What shape?
Alright.
After breakfast.
So how you feeling about the new company?
You excited? About the new company?
After breakfast.
No, I'm whipping them.
Just let go.
Let go, please. Just gimmee -
I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
 I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.
Don't patronize me, Pam.
I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
It's totally impossible!
Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
Okay, Ryan.
He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
He worked at that telemarketing place.
Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
Yeah.
Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'.  Umm...
Alright.
Oh. Wow. "Michael Scott Paper Company." Okay. Very official. "Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence."
How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
Okay. Okay. "Achey Breaky Fart."
No! No No. No. "My Stumps." Like "My Humps" but a guy with no legs.
We can do this.
Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back.  Ah, okay.
Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please.  It's Michael.
Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
I'm...
Excuse me. Yes?
Yes, it is.
Yes.
It is.
Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance.  Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
Uh, nine.
 Look what he's doing.
He's stealing them. Okay, okay.
He's already paying for himself.
Right here.
Oh yeah.
Sounds awesome.
People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.
Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey!  I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
By wanting it more. By working hard-
Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.
And I offer same day, free delivery.
Nana.  I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup.  Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
What's that?
Blech.
Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
Well we should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright.  Okay...
I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? 
You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up. She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.
 Okay.
It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
Yeah, I'm good. You good?
You know what they say, keep your friends close. 
Yes, I am, Charles.
Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin.  Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
