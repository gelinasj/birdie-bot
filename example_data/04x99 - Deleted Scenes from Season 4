Did you ever think of this? Would a sober person walk in front of a car?
Well...
That's not...
That's not what...no, no, I'm not saying that, that's disgusting.
I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk. Did you ever think of that?
Okay.
Maybe she hit me. You ever think of that? She hit me? I don't know whose fault it was. I wasn't exactly looking at the road.
You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith. I'll start. I liked her jumpers. They reminded me of Kindergarten. Jim?
Hey! Okay, okay, okay, You can just close that.
Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off? How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?
I'm not going to leave until you forgive me.
 Oh, okay.
This office is cursed.  And we need to do something about it.
Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex. I'm just saying, at least right here  is cursed. Conference room, 10 minutes.
On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed. On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.
We have to have done something wrong.
That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.
Oscar, are you Santaria?
Oh. Great. We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.
Yes. It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.
Stupid.
Yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems. What do I look like to you, Paul Newman? That's actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face. And I make my own salad dressing. I mix Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian. Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss. I could make... I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone  but I won't do it.
Whoa, 'scuse me! Oh!
Oh, slow! Oh, ho, ho, ho.  You guys are going so slow...
Come on, I'm going backwards.
Oh, all right! All right! All right! All right!
Okay! 
Thanks.
Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay. I will be paying out-of-pocket. Um... I kinda wish I'd been hit by a car.
Hey, doc? You forgetting something?  Thank you.
Yes. My old friend Ryan Howard is coming back today for some big presentation. Very, very excited. He is my protege. He is someone that I hand-raised, that I nurtured. Um... he is like a prime cut of veal whom I nourished with my milk. And now he is also my boss. So, win/win.
Oh, Okay. Okay. Just... All right.
You don't want me to help?
Yes?
 Um... yes, I'll be right back!
I think I know what's going on. Ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now. And there isn't. But, um... don't tell him. Don't tell him that. I don't want to jeopardize our friendship.
Ryan is causing some problems. And you were always good at handling him. What should I do to control him?
I know, I know, no, what... something else.
Uh-huh.
Good.
My generation's all about hard work and accomplishment. Like... the moon landing. Or Vietnam. Rolling Stones. Greatest band ever.
And still rockin', Oscar. One of the greatest all-time oldies was a little Oriental guy named Confucius. He literally invented the ancient Chinese secret. Here's some of his quotes. Confucius say, "Man who farts in church must sit in his own pew." Confucius say, "Man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day." Confucius also say, "Virgin like balloon. One prick, all gone!"
No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page. Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious.
I'm not. It's solitaire. See?
BlackBerry. Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit? You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit. 
This is going on the outside. The pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner. Do not tape those on.
Mmhmm.
I'm a little busy right now. Could you BlackBerry me a message?
 The one advantage to being older is that I know a few things about a few things, and I am young enough to not forget them. And old enough to know the difference between the two. I am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws, but young enough to date college girls. But old enough to know better. I'm at a perfect age. I could die now. But I won't, because I am young.
What's wrong with me?
I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me.  Don't avoid this. I know you're dying to say it, so just say it.
What, no. No. Okay, bags. I have bags under my eyes, Pam. I didn't see it at home, I didn't see it in the bathroom, I didn't see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light...
The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles? The big round things.
Yes. I have bags under my eyes, and I can't go to New York like this! What do I do? What do I do?
Really?
That's it?
All right! Martha Stewart! You can be Martha Stewart's receptionist! Very good! I will be tea baggin' it. Nn... no.
 Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to? Not at all. Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this. Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into. What are you gonna do?
I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time. They would say things like "don't pay for six months" or "you can transfer your account from another card"...
Do you think I'll get any new ones? I could... 
What do you mean, "what"?
Were you listening to what I was saying?
What is the matter with you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right, well, go find some. Get outa here, please. 
Yeah. What?
Um, my CDs.
I do.
My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case Logic
And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car. There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor  What?
I've been putting money into CDs for years. I bought music that I didn't even like. No. 
I can't.
I can't go back to that.
I don't know if I can do that. I can't see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.
We will? I can't. I don't have an idea in my head.
I have...
Okay. What? Um...
Tell me.
Well, please? I won't tell anybody.
Yeah, I will.
All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let's keep 'em coming... oh, God. Okay, Toby?
There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.
And that is probably why most ads suck.  Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?
About dressing your best today?
Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.
Okay, good. Good.
This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door. Pretty but nothing special. You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good.  Oh, Creed... is the old guy over there. Don't look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going.
And if not we can just make him disappear.  This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.
So do, um, do sad, do the sad face.
No, that's skeptical. Do sad.
That's, that's a pirate movie.  That's annoyed. Well, he doesn't do very well under pressure.
And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace. Follow me! Let's get this movin'. 
All right, let's start.
You are my producer, you are a suit. I am the creative genius. You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.
Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate...
...and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.
We start on a single blank sheet of paper.
And we widen to reveal ancient Rome.
Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.
Bull man!
This is bull!
Ahhhh! 
If you don't let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!
No! No! Jim, Jim, don't, don't...
No, I can do it.
I can do it good. I can do it good. Please, don't. Please.  Please give me it.
 Do you want this open or closed?
Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial. Huh?
I can't hear you!  Heard you a little bit less that time. Must be...
Okay, okay. Who could do music?
Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.
Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden... is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.
Woo! Shotgun!
Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you.
No, Dwight! Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me. You're gonna sit in the back left where I don't have to see your ugly moongob.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Dwight, you're handsome. You're a very handsome man, get in the car.
Dwight! Stop it!  Can you help me please, I'm being crushed.
Would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room? Like I begged you to? Pam would have understood. Heck, Pam would have done it.
You embarrassed us.
Come in!
Pam, are you my friend?
We have been friends forever, right?
Hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you? And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping. That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.
Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?
So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?
Thank you for your honesty.
Split the difference. Hey... mint chocolate chip, please? Is Jim out there?
Can you send Dwight in here?
Mmhmm. I had something very personal I would like to discuss.  Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?
Okay.
All right, Dexter, just give me the knife.
No, just get me a case.  All right.
MmMmm. All I need...
No, Dwight!
I'm telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.
 What is this called again?
I have some, uh, experience. I, um, once had to testify in a traffic accident case.
Yes. My testimony was actually very important, um, because the accident was my fault. .
Before we continue, I would like to make an opening statement.
. All right. Everybody feel better?
Na, Na-oh, Naa-es.
Ye-ohh. Ye-no.
Very nice! 
High five! 
 Can't stop.
Forgot normal talk.
My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn't come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm... And Jan definitely, if there was room.
Yes, I did, for you, princess. Even though I only went number one. 
 They need to be presented... royally... anyone?
Good stuff. All right. Let's get down to some wine drinking.
It's been a rough couple of weeks.
Little trouble. Yes. Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.
Yes.
So she's passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog...
And the neighbors blamed Jan.
It's like, you know, the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place. Anyway, it's a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds...
So...
Well.
It is moving day. I have spent the last month here at Dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after Jan and I, um  ssp... No, I did not kill her. We were just at different places in our lives. No, I thought I'd be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo. She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale. Fresh outlook, and it's all good.
Oh. What is this?
You were charging me? I'm your friend.
There was no other guest the entire time I was here.
Okay. All right, Dwight. Take my money. Go ahead. Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction. The late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends. Just ring me up. Go ahead .
Thank you, Dwight.
Dwight, little help with the bags, please.
So, what about you, Angela? Do you have any single friends?
A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or...
No, no, obviously older.
Love. Marriage. Baby carriage. Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song. Jan and I had love. We did not have marriage. We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.
 Hey, Kelly.
Nothing. Just hangin'. Chillin'. No agenda. Would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?
Yeah?
That's hilarious. What's her number?
Mmm... nah, that's too young.
Oh.
 All right, time's up! Pencils down. Please pass your future Mrs. Michael Scotts forward.
Pammy?
You don't have one single girlfriend?
I'm not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with. Just fun, healthy young woman.
A kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?
How 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?
You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesn't have to be a model. I'm not, don't rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories. There's face models, hand models, body models  - yes.
Really?
No, I am, it's all about the personality, Jim.
Send me a picture.
So far, these are my leads. A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher. It's a start.
You're gonna be okay, it's gonna...
Ahh, ooh!
 Come on, come on.
Here we go, let's sit down.
All right, shhh. Dwight, leave him alone.
You had a rough night tonight. But your life is very good, my friend. You've got a great job, you... you can have any woman you want, you're good looking, you, you know...
Frien..sss...yes, you're friends with a hobbit, and... look where you live. I mean, you've got it all.
No, I mean this apartment building, it's fantastic.
Well, now I can say that I went to a museum.
Ryan?
Do you ever miss us?
Ryan?
Do you remember what color my eyes are?
Dwight, I asked him.
Really?
Not just because he said it?
Ryan?
You know, I don't care what he did to me. He's mean to other people, that's what gets me. He's just...
Everybody. He just, he's always, he's always talking about people behind their backs to me.
Like that people are stupid, and that they're idiots, and that they're sluts.
Because he's mean. He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy. He talks about how gay Oscar is...
And that Angela's a midget, and that  your chin is too big.
I know, I know. I think it's tiny. I think it's too small if anything. And that your glasses make you look ugly.
Well, he's just mean.
It's complicated, Pam. I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.
Okay.
I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time. But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk. I... jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals. Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are. Big marble... jerk stand.
Pam, stand up.
Pretty disgusting.
Well, kids today have a very short attention span. They are into texting and video games and s*x, and they just, they get distracted easily. And today they're being distracted by the other booths.
 Hey, there! Michael Scott, regional manager, Dunder Mifflin.
That is a very firm handshake. Ow, ow, aahch! Killing my hand, there.
So, what is your poison? You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like...
Sales is and could be very, very cool. If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.
Right here. We have a lot of fun.
 receptionist extraordinaire.
Check that out, huh?
Pretty nice.
She sits there all day.
You get to look at her. Why don't you hold out your hand.  Tell me what you feel.
That's called card stock. That's what you're feeling. Now what you're feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... You're thinking, "Am I good enough for this job? Do I have what it takes?" And I think we both know the answer. We'll find that out together. You can keep that.
Mmm, yeah.
Don't fold it, though.
We have the Dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it's sexy, it's sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know? The other day, in the parking lot, I actually found a condom. So.  So, sexy is fun...
Hey, you know what? Coincidence - I am going to go for a little stroll myself. Are you psyched about the summer?
Yeah, me, too.
Okay, be my guest.
And do your worst.
 Hey.
So, I forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this...
One other thing I wanted to...
 Ohh...Nah.
Hey, Justin!
Wait, you want this kid to be in the Air Force?
Time out. You think this kid could be a fighter pilot?
Okay.
Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin?
Well, yeah, but you don't need the brochure. The brochure is up here 
I think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.
I'm right.
Oh, my God.
Toby Flenderson, come on up here.
Come on, no, no, no.
Toby!
Toby has written a fantastic speech for you, he spent a year on it. It's very funny and charming and heartwarming. And it rhymes, and if it's not any good, he has instructed us all to storm the stage and beat him to a bloody pulp.  No! So, take it away, Toby! Whoo!
Ach,  okay, okay, play the cutoff music.
Blah, blah, blah, blah...
...blah, blah, overstaying your welcome! Let's keep it moving! Let's keep it moving! Toby, everybody!
