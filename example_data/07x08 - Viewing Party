 They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street! 

 You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.
Walk with me.
 Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
Cancel it! Are you still here? 
MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show.
I'm joking.
I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry.  I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek.
You know who my favorite character is? The invalid.  I am coming to your party.
Kevin!
Yes, I am. Are you?
What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
Why did you just say he was the boss?
Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
Uh huh...
Big...
All right!
 Okay okay okay.
Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed!

Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you. 
Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin! 
Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah!  There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
Well some of us are trying to have a...
 Well I will turn up the volume.
Okay... Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!
Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?
 Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.
Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find.
Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se.
Well...
He's the longest baby in this room.
You know what Erin you do have to.

 Okay... Alright.
I just went out for a walk.
What? Really? That stinks!
What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
Are you kidding me?
Now that's going on?
Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot. 
No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
Why? I'm not your father.  All right.
Go to your room.
Go to your room young lady!
You listen to me. You listen good. You are are not, to see that boy, anymore.
As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
Oh do not raise your voice to me!
Gahh, I will pull this car over!
 If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.
Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray.
