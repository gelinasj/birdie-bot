No, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.
Hello, hello. Hey! Your face is almost back to normal.
Hey, Oscar! Come on, let's go!
I am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year.
Okay, no, I am not. Dwight!  I want you to take Jim's chair. No! No! His chair at his desk. He gets it back on Friday.
I want you to get your ass out of my face.
 That's what she said.
Well...
You're...you know what? I read in one of those books that you're not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.
I'm digging.
I can't wait to be a father. I'm going to smother that baby.
I really, I don't want to get panty liners, please...
I know, it's...
Yes.
I want you to get the panty liners.
Let's keep this rollin'... Ryan?
Oh, cr..., oh, God. Meredith, you know what? I just need a minute, okay?
What do you need?
I... really want to keep you.
Wait, what?
Nnnngah!
Oh! OK!
Seventeen. I say seventeen squares.
Do the boobs!
Hey! HR lady, stop whispering in the corner please. Very rude. You're ruining the party.
Oh, I guess that job that I got you is working out for you well, then.
Hey, if there's anything else I can do, just let me know.
You know what? I would love a slice of real New York style pizza.
Even as pie.
 some cheese. You gotta fold it up. That's the way you eat pizza.
I am going to run three possible date ideas by you and I want you to tell me which one gets your blood percolating.
I have two sure things, one wildcard.
Okay.
The wildcard is dinner at a nice restaurant.
Exactly. Here, here are my sure things. I blindfold her. I take her to the Houdini Museum. She chains me up...
Okay.
All right.
Number two, we go to the mall...
We go to the bed store, I let her choose whatever bed she wants...
And we have s*x on it.
Really? I don't know. It's a big third date, Jim.
What do I do?
Well, I thought as the man that I should make the decision.
Times have changed, Jim.
 This is gonna be awesome. This is gonna be awesome. I've decided that on my drives to Nashua, I am going to learn French, the language of love. And on my drives back, I am going to learn Spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.
 Okay, am I grabbing this one?

Fair enough.
Okay, okay. What kind of car games did you play in the 'hood?
Cow surfing?
Really?
Cow surfing.  Okay, here we go, there's a cow.
Oh, shoot! Okay. All right. All right.  Pull it over. Here we go.
 I'm gonna do it.
The man has a point.
 What? Why?
 I do! Hey, come on!
Jackson Five.
 You're the one.
You are.
No, you are.
You're the best.
You're better. You're better than my best.
Here we go.
Okay, Ready?
Watch this. Darryl, watch this.
Yeah
Yeah. Right, snuggle time.

Here's what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up.
We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It's like another seven hours.
Speak.
Absolutely. Oh, and you know what, Darryl? You are invited to go as well.
Come on, it'll be fun.
 Hey, look at that. Fun, right?
Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn't that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing.
Say what you said.
 I'll save you! I'm Superman! Scooperman!
I didn't ask.
We want the same things.
That is a lucky number. Seven. 7-Up. Seven dwarfs.
Seven deadly sins. It's a sign.
 Oh, it's really cold here.
Yeah.
 Can we have another? I think I blinked.
Oh, you have your own entrance. That's nice.
How did I propose, let me see... well, I drove her up to Nashua, and I had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful. And I got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star. And we were in a restaurant, and I put the diamond into a cheeseburger.
And she took a bite, started to choke. So what do I do? I have CPR training. Go around, start doing the Heimlich.
The ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger. Million-to-one shot. All of the Greek people in the restaurant start screaming "Opa!" Which means "congratulations," so...
I'm pretty much devastated.
Maybe go to Sandals, Jamaica. Or the other Sandals, Jamaica. I just don't want to go by myself.
Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical: A man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots. And, so he's like "What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important."
Great marks, Phyllis. 
I taught Jim and Dwight everything I know about sales. But there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that I now must teach them.
Attention, all problem sales persons. Jim Halpert... Dwight Schrute...
Intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch. That is all.
He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.
He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.
Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.
Betrayal ain't just a river in Egypt.
My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would....fall down. But then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He...stopped going out at night. He got a job. The fun just dried up. It was really sad. I don't want that to happen to you guys. I'm not gonna let it happen.
