 What do you think? I spent all morning on it.
It's just a really important day for me.
Thanks.
Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. 
No.
And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.
Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.
Yes. I said that yesterday.
Dwight...
No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke.
This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!
Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.
Get out of here.
Oh, my God, Dwight.
There's... a name.
Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.
Is that all you have on her?
You're an idiot.
 Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
Those glasses are super dark.
Alright. We need some tunes, I think.
You did?
That was nice of you.
Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.
Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
No. No. That's not how it works.
Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.
Mmm-hmm.
I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.
I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight.
I would do the same for you.
Yes.
Yes... just go--
Oh. Thank God.
Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.
If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
Ok.
I don't have a room?
Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'
Jerk.
When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don't know what happens because that story hasn't been told yet.
Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
You... are... kidding me.
I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?
That's rude.
You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.
How ya doin'?
Nice to meet you.
Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
Didn't move my lips.
Head table, where I belong.
Well, who's that one?
What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?
They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.
That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.
That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. 
And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
Yeah. Go ahead.
 Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--
Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation.
When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.
When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--
...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.
Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.
Jim.
That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.
I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
I have not found that to be the case.
Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
There's gonna be a free room?
Hi, Mema. It's Michael.
Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody.
Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there. 
You're welcome.
Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have s*x before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have s*x and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.
Exactly.
I know.
They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.
Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio.
What are you wearing?
Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.
Ok. 
Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.
 Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.
Yes.
Why?
Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.
They're men, Dwight.
Something is wrong with you.
 Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly.

Mmm! It's after midnight. 
Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back.
She'll be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons."  "And... and clip my toenails."
Now you sound like Kermit.
 Why don't you take a picture. It'll last longer. God. Can't I get a little privacy?
 Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit.
 How can you eat like that?
Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself.
She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger.
She was from Europe.
Uh-huh.
No.
Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me?
She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?
No... you're crazy.
She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it--
 I already have my European girlfriend.
Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.  And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me.
 Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either. Where are you sitting? You need a seat buddy?
Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go?
 Hey. Hi. Do you--would you have a snack in your purse? You're a mom. I just figured you might have--
Oh! Eww... apricot. Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
Oh... okay. Were you saving it?
I'm sorry.  Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes.
my weekend was bad so far.
I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm.
And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
It is a terrible year for love.
I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen.
Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually.  There you go. Use it in good health.
 Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look?
Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
