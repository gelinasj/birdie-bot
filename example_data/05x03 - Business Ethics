 What's going on?
 To be married?
WOO! Alright!
"Why are you helping her? You're not even dating." She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh...
Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax! 
 Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.
Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. 
 Can't set 'em up like that.
Can we have a moment?  Can I talk to you for a sec? Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
Yeah.
Do some... do some work.  People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.
 enough with the pencils.
I would not... steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry.
Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on.
I will go first. When I discovered YouTube I didn't work for five days. I did nothing. I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times.
To tell you or not. And I'm glad I did. I feel very very good. Cathartic. I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
Yeah, . Come on, anybody. Let it fly.
A siesta!
You are a thief of joy. Anybody else. Yeah?
Who hasn't? Good. Good! What else?
Mmm...
Well, let's keep this party movin' on.
Bruuuuuuuuuce.
Ach! Wuh---
That's crazy. That's crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers! Hoo-ooh! Wow! What time we got?  Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate.
Oh...
Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks. Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
Well, well. Holly... lujah! It's a miracle, you're at your desk.
Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.
Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady.  Sorry! You know what? Let's go out! Dunder Mifflin's treat. Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it? Ethical.
What do you think? What do you think of this place?
Istn't it? Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines?
Wow, that sounds so... warm.
Here too. You know what my favorite season is?
Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
Wow, terminator, terminator.
Yeah.
I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance. I mean, what sort of place is that to call home? And Meredith needs this job. This is her main source of money.
Ok, new idea. We don't report it at all. We just punish her.
Mmhmm, tell her she can't have s*x for six months.
I don't know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about. You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...
I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.
Yes.
Well... bleh busted. I don't...
Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers. 
What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
You get me.
I don't know. Can you? Kendall, my main man.
Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "I told you so." Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.
Ok, everybody listen up. If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it! 
Now is really not the time, Meredith.
