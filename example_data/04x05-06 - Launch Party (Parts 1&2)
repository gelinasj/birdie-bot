And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar?  Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination.
We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? 
Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.
Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a "Where's Waldo." 
 Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead.
That was awesome. Thank you.
Some days I am just on fire. What can I say?
Oh, does he?
Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you.
And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan. It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen...
The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight.
No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight.
What's that, pipsqueak?
Ohh, lunch party.
Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
Okay.
Really?
It's the European cut.
Umm... hey. Ah, what's hanging?
Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
I had um, one of those danishes.
Why don't you wanna go tonight? What... all your friends are gonna be there. It'll be fun.
Just...
Yeah.
Thank you.
Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.
Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.
So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins.
Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
Just let me know who the winner is.
Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.
Yes. Thank you.
Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you.  I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow.
You ever read this? 
Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured...
Same sort of stuff in here.
Mmwa. Mmwa.
Leaving Pennsylvania.
One for me one for Jan.
You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?
Wanna come over Friday?
After work you guys...
Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So...
What are you doing?
No.
No, I'm sure that's not. Na...
Yes.
Well the invitation says VIP's only. Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan.
You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.
Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
Yeah. I withdrew too.
Alright who wants to party?
Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight?
Oh hey! Good for you. Good for you. Scranton power. Alright you know what? Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on. Good.
This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home.
How we doing on time?
Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen.
Mmmhmm.
Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel.
I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...
Yes
Uh...
I want it...
I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?"
Yes you can.
Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it. Who else could do this?
No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!
Good news.
Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
Same thing.
You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
Pizza by Alfredo.
Okay, okay, what's better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?

Yup.
You don't have to say it like that.
Hey
Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.
You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.
 What do you mean hmm-um?
It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story.
I'm not giving that to you.
No, no you're not going anywhere. You're staying here until we figure this out.
You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room.
Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza. Please, thank you.
No, you don't even know what stupid is. It's about to get all stupid up in here.
You ready to give me my discount now?
Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
Alright, Dwight, knock it off. You better think about what you are doing young man.
No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
Yeah sales, you sell pizza. Last time I checked that's called sales.
Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
Stop talking all at once!
Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.
I think you're over-thinking it.
Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
Trouble. Okay, alright.
He said no.
No, no.
Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?
I'll just wave and introduce myself.
Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.
Hey, have you seen Jim?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid.
I could have paid for the pizza.
Oh my God, oh my God.
This is Michael.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
 Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
I will open the door.
And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
Yes.
See ya, drive safely.
 Okay.
Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.
What a horrible day.
Bluh.
Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what?
I'm going to get it.
Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
New York. Wanna go?
Alright, you drive.
Here we go.
Mmm.
Hey, you know what?  Come on, come on, let's go.
Guilty.
Oh, thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer.
Yeah.
 I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face.
I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.
I made it with my cheese pita.
I started a fire, I started a fire.
And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...
Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.
Wanna head back?
