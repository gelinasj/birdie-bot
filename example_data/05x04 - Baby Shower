Yeah.
OK, just remember to keep breathing.
OK, good.
Oh, OK! OK!
I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
I checked the route - there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby.
 Andy, would you like to have my baby?
All right, OK.  Sorry. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go!
Do it! Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
Aaaaaaaa!
Just keep pushing...
I'm right here.
I'm right here, I'm right here.
 All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe.
Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late.
No. You have to just push it out!
Keep simulating.
OK!
Keep simulating.
Yes, I do!
OK.
Yes.
Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go!  Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
Nice touch. Good. Let's try that again.

Hello ladies, how's my shower going? Phyllis, did you get the live storks?
Damnit, Phyllis! I'm sorry.  Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments?
She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons? You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?
It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.
 Hey, hey. What are you doing? Don't talk to them.
Make the party. Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis.  Pump it!
Ahoy, matey.
Ahoy. So, how you doin'?
Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way.
So this is Astird.
Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me?
I could have helped.
Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
No, I don't!
Can I hold her?
 All right, OK.
I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.
: Assst...
...trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're going to know them for the rest of your life.
 Lion King!
OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
 I'm fine, weirdo. Such an HR weirdo. Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
Ready to play some games? Let's do it!
Uh, duh.
No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do.
All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents.  I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
Whatta we got?
Oh!
She already has a stroller.
OK, what else?
Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No. No. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
I could have helped.
 Uh, yeah.
 I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.
Phyllis? Could you take-.
Hey guys.
Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
Yeah, I a baby daddy. Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
I just saw this baby daddy-
Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?
Well-
It's- that's different.
That's not a baby.
 Could I?
 I was just going to... I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
Sure you can't stay a little longer?
All right. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving.
OK?
Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God! Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
All right.
 You wanna go out?
I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.
