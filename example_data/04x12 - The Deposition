I'll call back.
 Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back.
You can't always work 200 days though.

Yep.
Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.
I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through?  Hi buddy.
Yeah, I hate that.
So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.
Well-
Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
Million dollars!
Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.
Perfect crime.
Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.
I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.
Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus.  Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
Hey hey.
I would love that.
Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.
It is.
Hi.  No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.
Okay. All right.
Yessh.
Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
Six years and two months.
That's what she said.
That's what she said.
Uh, wh-why would she say that?
Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it.
She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.
Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk.
Yes.
Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.
Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here. 
I will allow it.
Uh...
Uh-huh.
Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define "begin". I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago.
If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.
Line.
Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
Irie.
I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
 Can I sit here?
How can you give up my diary like that?
How'd you even find it?
I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
Fine. I love you.
Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had s*x with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.
That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot...  ...of water.
March 17th.
Yes.
 "I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs."

How can you do that to me?
Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
...Absolutely not.
Oh, hey no biggie. Just...
 Hey, David?
I think you're a nice guy too.
Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.
 What do you want to do for dinner?
Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
Do you fast food?
