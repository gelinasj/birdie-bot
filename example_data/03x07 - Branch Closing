There she is - Jan Levinson. First...
...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
 Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
Yes.
I don't understand.
On whom's authority?
What?
You're welcome.
Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
Oh...  Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
Well...
Oh, you gotta be... Josh?
Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.
Pictures. Memories.  Look at that. They grow up so fast.
Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.
Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...
Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
What?
Do I have any messages?
Ok, ok...
 Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
You knew about this all along, didn't you?
Traitor. You are a traitor.
I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.
Darryl. Noble Darryl. 
I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.
So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...
Awesome.
This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there.  Let's go.
Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.
No... way.
No. There's no one else.
Okay, okay. Um...
Why?
You sent him cards? You never met him.
Okay, this is it.  This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like "Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person." It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.
I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
All right.
Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
 Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.
Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
Don't touch me this time.
Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?

The office.
No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.
Anything?
What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
 All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
That was hilarious. The foam ...
Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.
Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.
God, Dwight!
What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.
Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!
What?!
We did it? We did it.
Right here! Right here! 
Yeah, baby!
We did it!
How did we do it?
I don't understand.
