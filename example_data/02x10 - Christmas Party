Here we are.
Oh god.
No, no, turn it around.
You'll break it.
You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.
All right.
Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have!  Nice, huh?
On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.
Merry Christmas!
Did it work?
A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.
 pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?
Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.
I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.
Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.
No! No way! It... no.
You wanna be Santa?
Have you ever seen Santa?
Okay.
Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.
That makes sense because he has elfish features.
You get something good this year?
Yeah? Who did you have?
I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.
All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?
Not great.
No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.
Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth."
No, don't!
Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
You don't know that.
I did?
What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
Oh hey, for me. What is in here?  Oh, come on.
An oven mitt? Okay. 
So Phyllis is basically saying, "Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth." I gave Ryan an iPod.
I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
Well, I call it fun!
Because it's better. Because it's more special.
Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.
Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.
Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
I think this is going great.
Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.
 I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.
Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.
Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.
 "In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute."
Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
Last gift. Kevin.
 What is she so upset about?
Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.
Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.
All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
Cool, cool. Box it up.
Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.
This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
Go, here we go!
Anybody making out in here? 
No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.
Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.
Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.
You're welcome.
No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!
Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.
Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.
Darryl. There you go.  You earned it.
No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
Hey, Merry Christmas.
 Lampshade on head! It's happening!
Yeah, that sounds good.
Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.
Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?
Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride?  All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
Okay!
