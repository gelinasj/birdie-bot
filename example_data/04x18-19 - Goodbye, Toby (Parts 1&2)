Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.
Mornin'. 
First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party.
Okay.
Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...
If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
Toga!
I thought that you might say that. 
Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. "Michael, buy a motorcycle." So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.
I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
Phyllis, can you do this?
 Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.
Why do you hate her?
You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.
Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?
We need to sell her an elevator pass.
Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
 Yeah.
Oh, hey, do you still work here?
Nah.
No. I think I will pass.
Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here: I'm gonna win.
Yeah.
T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
Y-You can-Michael.
Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet.
Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?
I bet.
I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
All right.
Yep.
 I am downloading some N3P...
Music...
For a CD mix tape...
For Holly.
And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
The two levels being, uh, "Welcome to Scranton"...
And "I... love you."
Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
I think I do.
Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.
Well, you're not a romantic.
Oh really?
Like, with who?
Pam?
Yeah, you took it too slow.
This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
I don't want her to get away.
Hello, Holly.  Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.
And the sequel, "Woman Stands at Desk and Works." So, I have no idea how you,  how you sit like that.
 Yo-da. Um...
So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.
Kidding.  Acting!
 Acting!
Yeah.
I did it! 
I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
Whew, oh God.  Laying a base. Laying a base...
 Yeah...
Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?
Yes we do.
I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'.
Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
Hey! Hi, good to see you.
I'm just having a little exit interview.
Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
Okay.
Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed.  I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?
Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
Thank you.  What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
Well, no no no no no...
No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.
 I'll kill you.
Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...
What the hell is that?
That's... What do you mean, "Michael"? That's not even my handwriting.  Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
No!
Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.
My gift is forthcoming, Pam.
I am going to give Toby...
...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?
How did you know?
Well... That's my watch.
Hey, that's good.
 Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.
 I'm just worried about my friend.
Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
I'm cool.
Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.
No antigravity machine, huh?
Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
Thanks.
I like, uh...
Hey. What are you doing?
What the hell is going on here?!
There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
Why did you do that?
No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best.  Take care of that, all right?
Shh...
I'm really sorry.
Yeah...
Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it! 
 You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
Probably the best one that we have ever had, right?  But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
I have done things like um, "Beers in Heaven."
Or, "Total Eclipse of the Fart."
I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby.  Do you know, um, "Goodbye Stranger"? Supertramp?
 It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.
 Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise...
 Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!
Oh, hey. Thanks.
Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual.  Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.
What is it?
Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right?  No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.
O-kay. Hello Jan.
Wow, Kevin, really? We're-  Is this why you called me down here?
Oh, okay.
Thanks, Kevin. Um... 
Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you!  Are you nauseous?
Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?
Good. Good. Thank God.
Cause that's...
Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...
Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...
... proud.
Um...
You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?
Well, okay...
So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...
You did?
When we were going out?
W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
IHop.
I'm glad you told me.
Um, I'll... I have to think about it.
My whole life, I have known two things: I love s*x, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.
Hey.
Yeah?
Oh, wow.
Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar.  Oh...
Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.
Have a good night.
Bye.
Well this is it. I am here to see you off.
Sorry. Corporate policy.
You might take something.
Okay, security guard.
Okay.
 I am going to be... kind of a daddy.
