 I'm hungry.
Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!
Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Alright, everybody here? Yes.
Yes pleeeeease! Thank yooouuu!
Entourage!
Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
Don't whine. Get the window. 
Previously on Varsity Blues...
 Hi Jan! Hope you brought the Milk Duds!
People work faster after...
No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
Ok.
Ouchy.
Three hours, wow. Have fun. 
Hi.
Oh. That's nice.
...what?
...you were at the dentist?
Ok.
What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover! ...ish.
Hey Dwight.
Do you want an M&M?
No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good.
They're good, huh?
Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
Sounds like a good dentist.
What's his name?
Your dentist's name is Crentist.
Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist.
Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em.
You should... floss.
 Well then... I am glad you're ok.
Business is like a jungle. And I... am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  Pun. There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology.
Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?
 Wow, this is tough.
Ohhhh. Arrrgggh!
Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me.
Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally.
Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it.
 Perfect, well, we're settled.
All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.
Ohh..
 Can't you? That's so nice.
Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.
Hey, hi, hello. Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.
You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
Because, Dwight... never lies.
Because that's all it takes.
Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?
Oh, I'll be fine.
No, no, I don't, but---
I... won't. I won't.
Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.
What?
But you said you liked it. You've always admired it.
 Take it back.
That's my car.
THAT'S MY CAR.
I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know.
Jan called me about your little meeting!
I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight?
Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
Not. Good. Enough!
I have a laundry machine!
I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
You can get up. Get up. 
Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate.
Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and I'm making him do my laundry for a year.
