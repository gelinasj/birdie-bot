Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place. The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. 
Pfffffttt.
You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.
Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
Okay, alright.
I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
I don't know.
Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
 Toby, just do it! God!
Good work. 
 Morning everyone.
Hello!
Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. 
Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.
No, I gotta go. Text me later.
Hey.
Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
That... exists?
Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.
Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.
People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out.  It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
I am Beyonce always.
Yes, I am.
I would love that.
I have work to do.
Let's go.  I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
All right, Andy, please.
Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.
Right there. The coach!
Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
You have no idea what you're talking about.
You don't. No, no.
You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, "Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?" "High-five, Donna." "Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?" "Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit."
Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.
I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.
 Okay.
No. God. You go talk to him.
No, no, no.
I'm good. Oh, my God.
Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, "I'm sleeping with your wife." And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.
Okay, orange slices. There ya go.
Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
You love it. There ya go.
Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.
Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
I did.
No. We just talked. He's very nice.
It did not.
Isn't it?
I'm awful, aren't I?
I'm an awful guy! Ooh!
I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
I don't care. I have an appetite for life!  Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.
You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.
Yeah, I noticed that.
Nope.
I have got big balls.
Okay.  All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.
Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
Nobody better try to stop me. Good. 
 At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.
Yes?
 Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
