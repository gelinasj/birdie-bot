Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
That's a nice tie.
That is... who makes that?
Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
 What's the dealio?
What's the problem?
So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
Yes.
Yeah?
Okay.
What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
Okay... what?
Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized.  Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
 My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
 Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using "I" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements.
Come on, seriously, that?
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
 It is done!
Yes.
Are those all the other complains?
I would like to see those please.
You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
Okay.  All right... is that it?
Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
 This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee?  Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
That's what she said.  The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ?
Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And ... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
Uh...  Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
Here is a Kelly complaint: "Ryan never returns my calls." Ugh, join the club.
 Yes?
What?!
Stanley. 
 You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
Someone complained that the men's room is "whites only". Stanley, you know that's not true.
Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
Oh... ok.
Okay, well... all settled, then.
OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution: Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
Uh. Dwight.
Okay! Calm down.
Hey, hey!
Stop.
Okay...
Dwight...
Stop...
Oh... kay...
Okay.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
 You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.
Okay, so Dwight, in your own words -  "Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to."
 "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can." Gah. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone."
 "Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'."
"By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier."
The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.
Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.
Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?
Good. Okay.
Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?
It'll take like two seconds.
Ugh... All right. Everybody,  come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
Come on, everybody.
We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
Good, let's check that out.  Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
What?
 You just press the button.
 Okay, good. Check that out.
 That's terrible.

It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
 Didn't say three, did I?
But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.
And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
