TMI. Too much information. I used to say, "Don't go there," but that is so lame now. Or, "You go, girl." Or... Um, when did "Where's the beef?" That was, like, a long, long time ago. It's funny how the shelf life of these things, like how long they last, like, "Too much information" probably came on the scene... I mean, I didn't hear it till, like, this month, so it's pretty recently. Um, but you know, they're generally good for, like, no more than five or six years.
All right, we need something for Kevin.
What do we know about him? He's an accountant.
 He's fat. The fat accountant award.
I am the fat accountant.
Here he is.
Really? What did they say? "For a good time, call Michael Scott"?
Why do you think that? You just immediately go to that, Dwight? Why are you so negative? Why...
I mean, you just come in and you're just negative...
...and you just walk negatively.
Do you want me to find out what it says?
Yes.
What does that even mean? What are you... What are you talking about?
Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me. But don't tell anybody that I have anything to do with it because if they ask me, I will say that you are crazy.
Thank you. You won't regret this, Michael.
I hadn't planned on including him.
Kevin.
Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?
Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character.
Really? Well, he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have, who talks exactly like that, so, I think you should take it up with him instead of me.
 Well, neither of you are Chinese, so what... Why do you care?
What?
Dwight, you've hit a new low here.
That is a good point.
Okay, all right, I will do that. I will get to that definitely. Absolutely.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe after I finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show. All right, just relax, keep your pants on. Unless, of course, you're in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without Creepsville Central spying on you. Good.
Here we go.  Hey. How you doing?
 You down with the Dundies?
 You down with the Dundies?
 You down with the Dundies? You're all my homies
 You down with the Dundies?
 Yeah, all the homies
I have listened to that song so many times and I still don't know what OPP stands for. Other people's... Something. I... 
All right, our next award... ah, yes, this award goes to the most creative writing on the ladies' room wall, and the winner is... Who is it? Who wants to claim it? Shiny Dundie. Who wrote it? Great idea, Dwight.
He's hot, all right? What do you want me to do about it?
 It was unanimous, Toby.
Well, okay, I based it on what I felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this isn't even about what Ryan thinks. It's about you. It's about how you feel about the Dundies. Admit it.
Yes, it is true.
Okay, I don't have time for this. I need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration.  Me Chief Michael Scott. Here to trade...
Don't wanna forget that.
Absolutely. Is this mine or is this Chili's?
Keep it. My gift.  Thank you. Have a good night. See you next year.
Good morning, Pam.
What's going on?
What?
I don't get what you mean.
Well, you said I looked thin, so what does... Does that mean I'm like thin weird or thin handsome or... 
Yes, well, of course. Of course. 
Office romance. For example, Pam and I are dating, do we have to disclose that?
No, but I'm saying hypothetically if we were dating...
Well, Roy is dead, and I ask you out.
You say yes, and we go out.
And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby.
Toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more, so that's kind of embarrassing. Not that I'd mind, but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work. People seem to like him because they think he's one of us, but he's not. He's this weird loner who just tells people, "Don't do this, don't do that. Hire this person for this reason." I would complain about him, but who would I go to, to complain about Toby? Toby. Bias. And what does he do about that? Nothing. Because he's Toby. What kind of name is that? It's almost a girl's name. I think I've known more girls named Toby than guys. He just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit. Toby is the devil. Toby's the devil.
Oh, okay. I'll tell you. Let's see here. Three bedroom, two bath...
...contemporary townhouse. Two car parking...
...wall-to-wall carpets...
...all fixtures included. Yes, this is... This is looking good.
I think it does.
Yes.
I think it has a... Yeah, it has a deck. They call it a porch, but it has a deck.
When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind. Was I well-loved? Check. Did I express myself? Did I let my light shine through? Check. Will an attractive woman cry at my funeral? Check. Probably more than one. Check. Check, check, check, check. Lastly, did I achieve success and own real estate? And when I close on this condo, I will be able to check that one as well.
Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem. 
Are we ready?
Are we gonna do it?
This is all mine. All the way down around the corner. It's a shared space, but I can use it whenever I want to,
Ah, the volunteer Sheriff station.
No.
Oh, anything bad?
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
No.
I don't need a gun.
Hello! How are you? I'm, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and I guess we're going to be neighbors. Very cool, very cool. So, uh, so what's the vibe? What's the vibe of this place?
Oh... That's gonna change. 
Because I loves to party and I'm gonna be partying my butt out at this place.
Here's a question for you. I have a convertible. Is it safe that park that in my driveway.  All right. See you soon. Good guy. Um, cool.
I think I'm going to make myself some microwave popcorn.  Press "Popcorn." Oh, that's gonna be delicious. I just love having popcorn in the middle of the afternoon. You know what? I could do with some hot chocolate as well. Oh, drat. I can't make hot chocolate and popcorn at the same time, unless, I can. Boom! Second microwave for le hot chocolat.
Oh, Carol. Hello, how are you?
Good to see you.
Second bedroom for the ladies. I mean, the extra ladies who aren't in my bed, or for friends or family, whoever wants to pop on by to casa de Scott. And right in here... What, what's in here? Uh-oh, bedroom number three. What are we gonna do in there? Limitless possibilities.
What?  What are you doing in there?
Oh, my God. Dwight.
You know what I might do, I might make this into a kids' room.
I will have a girlfriend once she sees this place. I'm gonna get married and I'm gonna have kids.
I'm not gonna date a 55-year-old woman.
No, it's not. Just shut up.
You're an ass. Shut it.
No, you don't.
I'm gonna back out of the deal. Nothing personal, but I feel like I have been taken advantage of here.
This smells of fraud to me. This whole thing just kind of stinks.
Rule three: Reach for the stars. And if you fail, see rule four. Rule four: Failure is not an option.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule.
Mmm-hmm.
No, I'm not trying to trick him. I'm trying to be a good mentor. So...
No.
No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.
I'm not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.
Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship.
When I was Ryan's age, I worked at Arby's and then I worked selling cutlery for a while. Cutlery that could decimate a penny, I kid you not. There were these shears that could cut straight through a penny. So I have life experience and work experience that Ryan doesn't, and will never have.
If I could change the life of one person, just one person. I... Actually, that's shooting kind of low. I already did that when I was born. I changed two people's lives. Mom and Dad. Um, if I could change the lives of 5,000 people... 10,000. No, five. I'd be satisfied with 5,000. I... 10,000 though, that'd be something. Wow, 10,000 people. Because, you know what? Even one is amazing.
Hey, you. Big Jim. And Phyllis. Working hard, Phyllis?
Of course. You're always working hard.
Keep it up. And there's Stanley. No costume? Well, no, not trying to fit in. I wish I had your confidence, I really do.
No, no. What could possibly be wrong? Everything's great. Just keep living your lives. Everything's gonna be fine.  You are all such wonderful, innocent people.
What? What?
Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it's you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can't say that I'm sorry. It's a relief.
You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you're not doing your job. Why don't you just resign?
Just know that if I could have fired you, I would have.
I'm going to have to do this Sopranos-style. Just whack him. Guys, could you take the freight elevator, please?
You know what? That's my foot.
You guys...
I will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue. Am I correct?
I don't know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?
Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.
All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided.  Wow, that's a fast elevator.
I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?
Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative. 
Leave me alone, okay?
Do you want some coffee?
 Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed?
Yeah, that's right. Fifteen years and three months. Wow, you were hired before I was. Must be thinking about retirement.
Why?
It's just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.
Yeah.
Just trying to be your friend.
Of course, I did. I always... Yes, I do.
Are you pulling my leg or...
You have no clue why I've asked you in here?
Oh, here we go. This... um, here's the deal.
Yes. Actually, I have. I have been on a hunting trip. I shot a deer in the leg. I had to... I had to hit him, I had to hit him with a shovel for about an hour, so he... That's good eating, though. Venison's very gamey. It's hard to watch, though. It's hard to... It's hard to hit another living thing in the face with a shovel for about an hour. That... I haven't been hunting since then. I, I... 'Cause that's, you know, where's the joy in that? Where's the... There's no sport, really. Especially when you're the one with the shovel. And they're the one just lying there. Um... I would have rather hit it with my car or something and just... I was just smacking the hell out of that thing. That was a mess. And we just left him there. I didn't eat it. I didn't want to eat that. That guy. Why do you ask?
His name was Devon.
The human being man's name was Devon.
 Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, it is.
Uh, well, I am. A little. Justifiably. My Halloween is ruined.
Do you? I don't think you do. Devon was one of my best buddies. And now he hates me.
 You're glad?
Thanks. Thanks so much. You think it was good?
 Think I did a good job? Great. I feel good. I'm gonna give myself a pat on the back.
There. I'm doing it. Right there. Great.
 Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
You people are revolting. By far, the least popular people here. I should have fired you. Who knew Devon was so popular and had so many friends. So well-loved.
Yeah, I don't think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I'm talking about.
I've never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die.
No, that's not how I meant it.
Shut up, Dwight.
Yes.
Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang. 
Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?
God, you look like such an idiot. 
Stan the man.
Did you hear about the fight? Well, it wasn't much of a fight, actually.
I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
I went medieval on his heinie.
Hey, Stanley. I don't tell you how to do your job, do I? He...
Grow a pair, Stanley. Right? There not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines. That's not how business works, okay?  Okay.
 All right. Here you go, Princess. Just finished with part one.
Yes, under my tutelage.
If you didn't badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now.
Have you ever heard of Doctor David Friendly?
Doctor David Friendly's Egg Yolk Diet. It's, it's kind of unique. It's just, my diet the last couple months has consisted mostly of eggs yolks and cottage cheese. And, um, what you do, you don't just have the egg yolks, it's not like a Rocky thing. You do like hard boiled eggs and I got one a those melon ballers  I know, I know! But you know what? It's perfect. I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what? Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing. The guy, I think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... I, well, the melon baller was my idea.
 Not today, Kevin. Cannot be around carbs today. You know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?
Uh huh.
Conflict!
I have a conflict with that.
Uh, I have a pajama party. At the Playboy Mansion. With the bunnies.
I can't get out of it!
Ok, alright.
I'm hearing you, meeting confirmed.
Meeting confirmed. Would you like your confirmation number? Please grab a pen, because I will only be repeating this once.
42897. Ok.
What is a closer? A closer is a sales term for someone who always gets the job done. And that is me. A B C, always be closing. Glen Garry, Glen Ross. "Hey, gimme the Glen Ross leads." "No way, they're just for closers." "Do you know who you're talking to?" "I'm Michael Scott." "Really? Well, take any lead you want." "No thanks, I don't need 'em." Because I have a client list  So suck on that.
Oscar, I'm ready for you.
So...
Um, you're in accounting...
So, good, good, good. Something to work toward, being here more. I'm a big believer in people being here more.
All right.
Yup.
Absolutely.
"I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period." Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?
Yes, it is.
Yes, I did.
Hell, yeah.
Yeah.
What?
Kind of, yeah. Over the shirt, my elbow, but...
Um, yup, wait, yes.
No, there... Later there was.
Yes.
I didn't, you know, it was... It was dark, for one thing.
Let's just push on, shall we?
It's next. Just keep it. "Look on the supply shelf." What? What is that? All right, Ryan, look on the supply shelf, would you?
Okay, yeah.
Okay.
Okay, field trip's over. Come on. Could we please get back to this?
All right, don't break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, Stanley?
Christ Almighty.
All right, next suggestion.
"Don't..." Okay, that's blank. Don't. Just...
Well...
Crystal.
How pleasant. You can...
Okay, I think we're good.
Yeah, that got a little out of control. Jan's taking a break, which is fine. I'm doing the same, just chilling. Getting my mind off of us. She's right. I need to be more professional at the office. When I'm at work, I need to focus on work. I should call her ex-husband.
Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that's right, yes. Um... I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?
Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.
Never...
Well, then, Gould wasn't kidding.
Nothing, I just...
Nothing.
No, I did not.
Maybe I did. Maybe I called him, I don't know.
I...
I didn't do that. I... Maybe he called me.
Ex-husband, you have to let it go.
What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.
Um...
Nope, nope. I actually wear a turban sometimes. Wanna see it?
Got it right here. 
Comedy; it's funny. It's Johnny Carson, Karnak. It's, um, put it back. Huhhhh, did you have Johnny Carson in your land?
Oh. You were forbidden.
Alright, I'm gonna, uhh, get a cup of coffee. Do you want some coffee er-
Or some tea or hummus or something?
Should have done this a long time ago. Tons of personal e-mails, huge time wasters. Uh, uh huh. Wow, like Kevin, rating the best bars in Scranton? Poor Richard's number seven? Idiot. Stupid load.  Yeah.
Yeah, I'm busy right now. 
Here's a helpful suggestion for Jim. Jim, instead of e-mailing Amazon, to try and get that CD that you didn't receive, I suggest that you go to Visa and tell them to cancel the charge.
It's seems like ya did though-
Jim. Lots of e-mails to Amazon, lots of wasted computer space. Alright, let's get back to work.
 Ooo, bleh bleh bleh.
I don't know. Just felt like taking it off. Man, work can be just so damn frustrating don't ya think, Jim?
I don't know, same old stuff. Same old. Boss just been ridin' my ass.
I don't wanna talk about it. I just wanna hang out, just be one of the guys.
That's not the point.
Yeah.
Ok.
Ok yes, I would never do that.
Ha.
No, this is completely the time, this is perfect time. This is just guys gently ribbing each other, it's what it's all about, just hangin' out. Enjoying friends, all being the same. Worker bees.
No, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around.
I'm not a master bee.
I'm just a bee, Dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin'.
Five o'clock. Time to go get my improv on.  That is a dinosaur getting ready to go to improv class. Just a taste of the improv.
I need to know... who shot Johnson!
Shut up!
I have a right mind to shoot you right in the head.
Just shut up! I don't wanna hear anything more from you.
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! No deal. Not with Michael Scarn, FBI. Michael Scarn doesn't make deals. Michael Scarn shoots and then asks questions later. 
She was kind of tripping me up, cause she was, um, I was trying to get something going, when I was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story.
Well, you kept-
Going into nuclear something; that's not where the scene was going.
Well, it goes, it goes in the best direction, and that was not the best direction.
Well, he, Michael Scarn, that character, orders people around, and that's, you should of just gone-
Well...
I don't think there's any stronger choice than being a really strong character.
Well, it's, like, well, it's, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence, that's...
Exactly, thank you.
I appreciate that.
Or Ryan Stiles, something like that.
You shouldn't have been, 'cause you were dealing with Michael Scarn. That was exactly what I was hoping to achieve, so that is probably the best thing you could have said, that's a compliment.
Good work.
I'll just throw out some suggestions.
They're in a whorehouse.
And he's a proctologist.  What?
First sentence is: "I'm a proctologist".
Alright, I'm ready here.
Remember on that animated special when they taught the uh, the monster to put the star on top? That's Dwight. Dwight's the monster that we taught to put the star on top of the tree. You take his teeth out, and he could put the star on top of the tree.
Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela's kind of... Angela's little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.
Dwight is... Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.
Well, thank God you didn't steal my oven mitt. And Oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.
Oscar, paint ball pellets.
Yeah. Like anybody would want an oven mitt. 
See, that's what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, "Man, I wish I got that." I mean, that's just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don't know, it's just... I don't know, just makes you kind of feel good.
 Yeah.
Hello.
Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have a seat.
Oh, every man's dream.
Two ladies at once. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, you heard something. Um, yeah, it's a booze cruise, but it... There's more to the story than that. It...
Leadership off-site. Uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme...
Yeah, I don't even know why I said booze cruise. I don't even think there's booze on the boat.
Of course.
Of course, of course. Yes. Yes. Look, I have a whole program planned. Jan, this program is going to change people's lives. I am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.
Hello.
Oh, cool. Cool. And maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night. Awkward. That's... You know what. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
Really? You seriously said that? Okay. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
Thanks.
Oh, okay.
I'll see you later.
I'll call you later.
That's like...
I'll call you, too.  So. You are probably gonna get carded, so I can make you a fake ID. We have a laminating machine.
What is a sales department? Oscar, what do you think?
I'm not giving you the answer. Deck hands is one. And...
No, I'm first mate. You're second mate. I'm first mate, as the captain.
Well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down. Toby is the anchor. Oh, God. He, well...  Tell you about Toby later, he's awful.
Oh, hey, Toby. So... It's an analogy.
 Hey! What's wrong with you? You missed the boat.
Idiot.
No, no, no. That's his punishment for not being here on time. Too bad, anchor!
Your problem now, Captain Jack.
Hey. You know what the best way of studying is?
Flash cards.
You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here.
That is a great way to kill this party. Not on my watch. Let's, uh,... Let's rock. Let's rock some stuff here, okay?  Does you guys know that? Take the bass. Take the drums. What?
You know what? I don't think it's in...
That's not in tune. I don't know if you can...
...make much of out of it, Creed. Good luck to you. I don't know. It is a defective ax, my friend.
Good luck.
Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I'm old.
Yeah! Toast!
That's my line! That's my line, That's... I always say that at weddings. So I'll just think of something else to say. I... 
Hey, Jim. You got a hat?
Thanks.
Uh, that's what she said. See, haven't lost my sense of humor. No, no need, it was a non-stick grill.
I always keep a stash of bubble wrap at my house. Some days, hectic, tiring days, I just like to go home and zone out and click on the tube and pop a few. Very soothing.  Want to try?
Right, I'm gonna spend the day in the hospital, bujehh. Bureaucracy and germs.
Yes, so, no thank you.
What?
Wow, I don't want to hear... you talk. Pam, could I have a word with you in my office?  Oh, oh, oh. Alright.
Yeah, I've been sayin that.
Did you know I used to be in HR?
I used to be in HR. I was a Hell raiser.
Right? 
Alright. Movin' on.
Ry-an. You're here. Whatcha got, whatcha got? Alright, Panic Room, Maverick, Nell, Sommersby, The Accused. Where's Little Man Tate?
Oh come on.
Oh man. It's not a Jodie Foster afternoon without Little Man Tate, buddy.
Mmm, I'm telling you the best cure in the world is comfort food. You know how they say "stuff a cold"? Well I don't care you've got, the flu, Lyme disease, emphysema, you eat an entire dark meat chicken, you can walk on the moon.
No.
No, I'm not calling your weirdo cousin. Twenty-seven years old, never left the beet farm.
Guh-od.
Ok, I'll stand near you.
Next-ish.
Shh shh shh shh.
No. Do you?
Hello. Pammy want a cracker?
Oh, Pam with the dirty talk. 
Oh!
No, he meant to put it right next to the hole, that's much harder to do.
No, no, no, no. I don't want to chip my mug. Please get that off the floor. 
All right. Jack Nicholson for birdie.
It's a celebrity tournament.
Do you see it?
Do you feel it?
 God... damn it, Dwight! That's great.
 That won't be necessary.
Look at all them out there, my little worker bees buzzing away.
No, I am the King bee,
No, King is higher. Then Ace. I am the Ace bee.
Keep. I will finish that later.
Yeah, I know when it's from, Ryan.
Yeah, I rushed a few fraternities, but you know what? I don't believe in paying for friendships. So, I made a decision not to accept any offers. And fortunately none were made. Which was good, so nobody's feelings got hurt.
Thank you, Dana.
Keep the change. Here you go buddy, happy birthday.
You're welcome.
No, no, no, no. I have the long sleeve. And actually, you know what we should do? We should wear them tomorrow to work, it'll be hysterical.
Okay, Tuesday. Whenever. You'd better try it on, make sure it fits.
 Okay, that quantity of cotton fiber will cost you... my screen disappeared. I know. I will click on the bottom and... Yes. I'm getting one of those little hourglass things. Used to have a price chart on the wall, now it's a little hourglass thing with an arrow next to it. Now it's just an hourglass thing. Uh-huh, yeah, well, or I can call you back. Okay.
What's going on? Anything here?
Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or...
Ah. Small?
Huge?
Would you say the sale that I made earlier was huge or...
What was that?
You call that a sales call? My God, what have they been teaching you?
Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?
No, I did not.
Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.
Do you know a joke?
Call a client right now.
And tell him the joke.
Strike while the iron's hot. A joke always works.
Just sell it.
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.
Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line.
The old one two. Let's do it.
 Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he's a little... Little dim. He's the janitor's brother, so...
 Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can't even find their way to work? That is Dwight.
 What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.
 Uh-huh, yes, I can do that. Absolutely! Perfect. Oh, I'm glad it timed out that way.
I really thought these people were my friends. My best friend since kindergarten, Elliot, that's a friend. Best friend ever. I should call him. Wonder where he lives.
Oh! I don't know, Pam. I paid $400 for this phone because I liked the ring.
And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed.
There's a lot of choices. You got to help me here.
Which one of these is coolest? What do you think? 
No, no. 
Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, "I am so lame." Know which one I want? There's one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It's like...  You know what I'm talking about?
Yes.
What are you guys talking about?
Cool.
Working on it.
Yup.
All right.
Everybody, hello, can I have your attention, please? Since it's Valentine's Day, there's something that I wanted to say. I love the women of this office. Pam, I love you.
I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.
I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.
That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and p0rn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it.
This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great.
Great. Thank you.
Okay, here's the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, "Oh there's nothing between us and stop talking about it." And "Border-line harassment when you call me at home." But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine's Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.
You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.
That's it? You're going to end with "etcetera"? Okay, what's this big organizational system that...
That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.
It's your delivery...
Our biggest worry.
My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That's why p0rn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you. 
See, I have your attention now, don't I? You're scared, but now you're ready to learn.
No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We'll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.
All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke.
Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.
Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go.
Who's gonna start. How about Phyllis? You kick us off and then we'll move around. Go ahead.
Anything your heart desires.
 Louder!
Good. Good, good, good. That's good. Now see, that's not so hard, right? All right. Who's next? Who are we going to... Ryan. Ryan's next.
Don't be shy, shy boy. Don't be shy. Get up there.
Stop! Stop! Stop! That's, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It's certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so...
Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.
Ghosts. Lots of ghosts in this old Radisson. There it is, Rosebud Room. Memories. Wow, this turnout is pathetic. I packed the house, you know.
Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room.
Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.
You're weird.
Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.
Ah, look at me. I'm huge in Wilkes-Barre. Performing nightly, Michael Scott. Not comedy fans here, which is fine because not having a sense of humor is just as fine as having one. Questions? Comment? Can't see you, but I know that you're not breathing. I know you're breathing. Is this on? Hello? "Well, isn't that... Well, isn't that special?" "Jell-O pudding." Bill Cosby. I think Bill Cosby said it best when he talked about his brother and all of the fun he... All the great things they did together as kids. And there was the one time when he put the snowball in the freezer, and it... And he waited for five months and then he took the snowball out and he threw it... He would have thrown it at the kid but then his mother had thrown out the snowball so he couldn't throw it. So... Bill Cosby is smoking! And now some race car.  Could you shut him up, please? I mean, who brings a baby to a sales conference? Really rude.
Hey, don't touch him, please!
Didn't do background checks of the warehouse guys.  Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Sure.
Okay. There you go.
That's not how I taught you, right? 
Okay, here's the thing about bosses and employees. A good boss will say, "Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate me." A great boss will say, "Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate yourselves, because you are the ones who made me great, and I will acknowledge your contributions with donuts."
Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present.
Good. Great.
No, I think you're gonna stay.
On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister's Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today.
 Mmm-hmm.
Oh, good. Okay. Don't tell me, tell them.
Oh, my God. That's a piece of cake. That's a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that's good.
Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry.
Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, "I have cancer."
Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.
Drugs are everywhere in our society. They are omniscient. If you look at the amount of pot that was smoked in the United States last year, that would reach the moon.
Exactly. I know. It's amazing.
Shut... Shut it. No. Just... Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.
One thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user, who's an abuser, because we don't know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it's somebody-like Stanley or Oscar...
No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don't! That's, that's... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me.
No? okay, fine.
Okay, well, I really think that... 
Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel.
Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?
Okay, well, I made up some fliers for everybody to take on your way out, in case you're ever tempted. So there you go. And, Dwight, you know, I'm very busy today. It wasn't even planning on going to the bathroom, so I don't even know if anything will come out.
Well...
I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?
Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.
On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.
I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, "What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?" Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.
There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, "I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu." See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.
There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show.  And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person.
Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.
"Cage Match"? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.
Everybody, in the conference room now, please. Thank you. Time is money.
No.
No.
I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun. 
How about a location?
Where the hell is that?
Okay, all right.
No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.
We already have that. So...
No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.
Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. "Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons."
"One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an..." Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we're... Okay, we're starting over.
Look, if anything goes missing, we will reimburse.
Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.
Paper money.  Yeah. The company's doing fine.
Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it.
Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle.
