 That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?
Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?
Andy, what time's the show?
How long is it?
Nope, can't make it.
They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy's play, they took mine.
I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?
Wow.
I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play.
And scene.
Oh, hey guys.
I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.
Yes.
Nope.
 This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons.
No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber.
Are you kidding me?
All right, I'm sorry. God.
Hello.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes.
Good.
You enjoy the second act.
Thank you. You, too. 
How is that funny?
 Boo! Boo!
Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots.
Yeah, good job. Well done.
Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em.
Get your eyes checked, chucklehead.
Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
That would never happen.
Okay. I appreciate the feedback.
I don't like that at all.
Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues?
Yeah, I get those every day after work.
Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.
I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.
I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
Come on, Andy, seriously.
In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun!  Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about.
No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act.
