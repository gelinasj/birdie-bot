The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. "Mental" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it.
Get out.
Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need "small talk." What topics can you use for small talk?
Mmhm.
Mmhm.
Yes, what else?
No.
Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, "So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?"
All right...
Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with.
What?
 The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman...
Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec.  Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
Push free play til tomorrow morning.  Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.
Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
Mmhm.
Yep.
Okay.
There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.
Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.
Okay, well.
Do your worst. 
 Oh, great.
Mmhm.
Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
No Dwight, not everything is a threat.
There is no such things as monsters.
Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.
I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
He did talk about a fire in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
 Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?
Okay.
Um it is, Grotti.
Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
I'm not gonna lock my door. 
It's Grotti. He's following up.
 "I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business."
Yeah.
Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?
Okay, I'm calling the police.
All right.
Shh!
That's not gonna happen.
What am I supposed to do here?
I was thinking exactly the same thing.
I don't know, I don't know about that.
Hold on, hold on! Just-
All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.
 What are you wearing? Who's Pat?
Let's go, come on.  God!
Forget it! Forget it!
 Take that thing off the table! Please!
Oh my God!
Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
Hello.
Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
Yes.
Well.
Okay.
That's not true.
Okay shut up.
I will have the gabba-gool.
The gabba-gool.
I don't, I don't have to have that.
Guys, guys-
That's okay.
Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.
If the salad is on top, I send it back.
I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.
No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad.
Hey, do you need any help?
He's a good mechanic.
I don't...
Okay, okay okay.
Yep, all right.
Put it down.
Okay.
Okay.
It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
It was a lot of snap decisions.
Yes!
Just get in the car.
Jim?
Oh thank God.
It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.
Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.
Okay!
Jim? Are you?
What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.
No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!
No! Oh my God!
No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!
Jim?!?  Oh my God.
Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?
Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?
All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.
But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.

If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.
This is Scott.
Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.
I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
You suck!
And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?
Doubt it. 
What a tool.  What?
No. What do you mean?
What?
Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.
So I looked him in the eye and I said, "Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead." I said something like that.
Erin?
Coffee?
Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back.
Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.
Go. Any questions?
