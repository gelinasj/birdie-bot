 Parkour!
 Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
Parkoooooour!
 Who's getting married?
If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming.
Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.
Did everybody know about this but me?

 You'll never guess what I know.
Eric likes Megan.
 How do you know this?
I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?
 Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said "The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle."
I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
Yes
Well...
 Stanley was on your group date?
 Does anybody else know about this?

There he goes. There he goes. 
So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?
Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say...
Stanly is having a midlife crisis.
Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
Who?

 You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
Stanley's wife is out of town.
Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?
 I don't get it!
Drugs?
 Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
 Stanley is having an affir.
I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say,  that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.
 That and that are the same letter.
No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?
T! Yes! Yes! That is a "T", and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there.
 Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good?
No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?
Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
 Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?
Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser...

 Stanley, are you having an affair?
So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
 So stupid!
I know, I know.
Oh, I bet.
Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?
Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.
 I'm not saying... a damn thing.
 You can count on me.
 Oh, that smells good.
Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.
Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike.
Uh huh.  Alright?
How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including "Stanley is having an affair." It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.
Yeah.
Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.
Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.
 I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here.
Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
Mm hmm.
 Did you hear Pam is pregnant?
Yeah!
 Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.
 Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.
 Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.
That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.

Nowhere.

 Okay, I made it all up.
Yes.
But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.
Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.
Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.
Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
 The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...
Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.
Yes. Jim...
Look at that! 
 How long have you known about the pregnancy?
A week? A month? A year?
Did you pee on a stick?
You should've told me.


Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.
No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.
No, no, I can do this.
Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.

Hold on a second, Cynthia.
Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly.  and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try.
