There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work.  He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
 It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
You mean cancer?
It is?
Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it.
How?
What?
Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
No! It was like four years ago!
Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six. 
How did this happen, how did I get this?
You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch.  It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
Oh my God! What if I did?
Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
There's no way I'm gonna do that.

Hi Donna. It's Michael.
I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
I can't even say it. H-I...
...R-P-E-E-S
No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
Does your stupid husband have it?
Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
No this is Holly.
No this is Holly.
Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
Oh really? Was anyone killed?
Any nuns?

 Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred?
We would have twins. 
Mmhmm!
Mhhmm! We would be married.
Do what?
I don't romanticize th-  No...
He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.
We were more than we were.
Ok, alright I gotta go.
It didn't come up organically.
It's nice to see you doing so well.
Bringing home the bacon.
 Would you excuse us...
He hasn't changed.
Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
What?
Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
Because we work together.
Am I the princess?
 Ok, so I'm the guy at the station.
I have herpes.
I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...
You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...
No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
Yes, I don't...
I know, I know.
Got it.
I'M TRYING! GOD!
 Hi stranger! Long time!
I'm Michael. We dated for a while.
Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...
Jerk. 
Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
Carroll, how are you?
I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
No.
Weird...
He sounds like a nice guy.
Oh wow another living room!
You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
I have herpes.
I just found out today. It's, uh, right there.
Mmhmm, I'm sorry.
I'm between specialists right now.
Well I believe in love at first sight.
I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.
Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
Herpes duplex.
I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
Flower shops, fireworks celebrations...
Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...
An electric car dealership. 
Oscar! Think abou- Think!
