Kahlua Sombrero, please.
Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
Oh, really?
And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.
I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.
No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
That's what I've heard.
Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
Really? What happened?
Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. 
No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar.
You are? What bar?
I... do not see you.
I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
What're you wearing?
Are we both at the right place?
I hear your voice.
I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man!  Michael Scott.
Wow... that is insane! 
 Here we go! Are you ready?
Alright! Here we go!
This is it. What do you think?

Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!
Come on out!
I am well, sir, how are you?
And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!
I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
Yes it was.
Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
You know me very well, Dwight.
Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
I sorta like the old way.
I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-
Is that good?
Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. 
 This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. 
It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do...  god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
That's-
You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
Don't shave my lips.
You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-
I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy.
 Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
PB and J, my mom's recipe! 
I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! 
What?
Oscar, here you go. 
No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in.  No body go in there. Stay where you are.
No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No.
Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.
Ok.  Why did you have to be so damn good?
No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
You'll figure it out.
