All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up. 
This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.
Dwight, Dwight!
No, I will ex-squeeze you.
OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.
Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.
Jimbo.
Did you see Holly's butt?
Why?
I know.
I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read "Lonesome Dove" three times.
And that her butt refuses to quit!
 That's insane.
I thought you had to pee.
 Pam, Pam! Hey!
 I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
No. OK. Um, the last word is "seagulls."
I took a lot from other poems.
All right, call-- 
OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.
All right.
All right!
 I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!
Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't.  Come on. Let's go in.
No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello.  Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?
Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts.
Damn it. Come on.
Here we go. Everybody on.
How's it going?
Good.
Cake? Who suggested cake? 
Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.
What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having s*x. And then again for seven years.
Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
No.
Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
Yes, all right. Who else?  Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
Booty call.
Here.
Wait a second.  I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
You want more?
 It's a pretty lame party.
You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
Let's go mini-golfing.
Uh...
Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?
Yeah.
Good luck.
Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
And what is that?
You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him.
I did!
Yes. Gooooo-tee!
Hey, you know what? I can't do this by myself people! Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out. 

 Mmm--- mmm... Um...
Close the door. This is your fault.
Your stupid friend zone.
I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man!
Mmm-hmm. Saunas.
Gah, the dreadmill. 
 Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful.  They are beautiful. He is beautiful. This big fat pig is beautiful.
It's my sumo suit. I just didn't inflate it all the way. I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.
Body image. We are here because there is something wrong with society.
If it's me, then society made me that way. Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?"
How do you know Michael Clump?
How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside... and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
Hey! Why don't you just sit down, please?
We're doing this because of you. So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.  Hey. Hey. You shaved?
Why?
Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.
You're right, you're right. Just, Dwight, do it. Just say it ok.
Finally. Right? Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat?  Ok, I want you to look at her. She's a beautiful Indian woman. Why? What makes her beautiful?
Ok, be more specific.
What about her looks?
Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
I want you to know. Kelly, look at me! I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug.  Mmmmmm.
Hey Ryan, look. Shaved off my goatee. I am goateeless. We are the goateeless brothers.
Ahaha, Yep! 
Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
Hey!
Excellent! Good job.
Yeah, oh, hey. Did he call?
No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call?
I dunno. I always call everybody back right away. He'll call back though. Give him until the end of the day, he'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco.
Ugh.
Wait, do we have until the end of the day?
 Hey, is that healthy food?
We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly. Please?
Ok, that is fine. Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
Aww, really?
I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...
...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
I know. I love Counting Crows.
Wow, really?
That's a shame. A shame to waste these. I want to buy them from you.
I do. No. I do. I, I want to. Trust me. I really do.
Ok?
Alright. Alright!  Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok? Case closed. Umm, can I pay you tomorrow? I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...
Is that good?
OK.
Darryl, would you do the honors?
Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning. This is a good day. You guys accomplished something big. You lost a ton of weight, literally. A lot of weight. And I don't care what any stupid scale says. You guys are all gigantic losers.
