Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
... Oh, God is that today?
Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in "Raw," and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in "Daddy Daycare." both great movies, but, still.
Well, I'll be in my office.
They're cool.
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
 I work with a bunch of nerds.
Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.
Oh.
Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
 They want how many spiral pads?
Okay.
 Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
 Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?
Nice to meet you.
Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor.  You want to try?
All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! 
Dwight! Dwight!
What the hell are you reading to them?
Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
What's a Nazi?
Don't!
Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?
 Why don't you just leave? Okay?
Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?
Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. 
This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these?  You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...
I'm not just a middle... man...
You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.
...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
Say hi to the kids.
Yaaaaay.
What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?
You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
It's true. I did.
I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this.  I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
Oka--
Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
 Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.
I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
Stop! Stop! Stop!  Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.
Yeah.
Uhh, I don't know.
Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it.
Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.
Coulda sworn there was...
...uh, no.
Uh, just never happened.
Uh, nope.
I do okay.
Yes.
Okay! Alright, okay.
...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye.
 Yeah?
Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.
Thank you.
You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
What about...
...Jan. Kay.
...Or biologically.
Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
Oh... kay.
Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one . Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.
 and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
One more time.  You...
