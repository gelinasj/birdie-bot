Hello son. If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead. Life is a road---
How, would you stop interrupting please?
Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life.
Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to.
To jump start a car, first pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then you take these and clip them wherever.
Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra.
We will demonstrate on Pam.
Come on.
 You just twist your hand until something breaks.
Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam.
And remember no matter what, I will always love you.
He's not going to be a murderer.
You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
Okay. From the top. Ready? Three-
Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding.  So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did. And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta.
I'm sorry. I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes. Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat.
What's up spinsters?
No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse. From 2:30 to 3:15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guy's night out. A G-N-O if you will. A Gah-No. Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in. A G-A-I. A gay. Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour long shower with guys.
Yes. Yes! Oh! There-oh! 
Oh God-
No, no, no!
I can't believe you're not going to be there. It's going to be good, it's going to be a great bachelor party man.
You should get out of them.
It's the only time he can do it. 2:30 to 3:15. It's going to be great. We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie. Going to be very delicious.
I did not order a stripper.
Um, not personally, no.
I can't get a stripper here. Sexual Harassment.
So that's what that means.
Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! 
Gay.
Okay. Co-ed naked strippers in this office. For realsies.
Okay. We are off. Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
Well get on it. And make it happen.

 Yes?
I'm in the, I'm in the s*x shop.
Squarepants?
And you think that'd be sexy?
Oh.
Oh. Hello!
You wearing a thong?
Hello ladies. Who here is a history buff? Who's a fan of buff naked? Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?
He's in his knickers. Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.
And when they came over on the Mayflower. Bow chicka bow.
Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one. 
Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.
No. Yes.
But I got all the foot off of it.
Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat?
Well then my man meat, he shall have. There you go. Deliciousity.
I call shuffle. Here we go. 
Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here. Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
Nice outfit.
He's right there. There he is.
Okay. Alright, I'll do it. Yeah. Lets do it. Lets do this thing. Yeah. What do I?
Alright.
Okay.
Here we go. Alright!
Not bad! Not bad! You smell nice. Like Tide.
You smell like Tide detergent. Do you use Tide detergent? Ha ha ha! I have a girlfriend so...
Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work!
On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me.
Really.
Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag.
Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women? Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
Wow. Thank you.
Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will.
I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
No, today at work.
Yes. I kind of arranged it.
So you don't want to end our relationship?
That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that?
You are. You are.
So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice. Which rhymed. Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't.
