 Hey, what's up?
Any emails today?
No? Um... Check your spam folder.
What?

Kay.
I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.
That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
Um, I...
Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's...  Whup! Come on! Hey!
Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!
Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.
Uh oh.
Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...
Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.
Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!
Oh, yeah.
Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there.
Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!
Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
Oh. Bad boy. 
Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
Hey, send me that link to the monkey s*x video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.
Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. "Old School".
Yes, Toby?
Um... literally two seconds?
Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.
No, no, Toby. No.
It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
What?
NO!
What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.
Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day.  So, take it away.
I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.
A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says "Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?" This is what's at stake.
Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are.  Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
What?
I don't feel bad.
No, I don't.
Okay.
Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
Thank you.
Hi, is it over?
No.
I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?
Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
She would have definitely slept with me.
Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work?  Would that be crossing the line?
What if they made out? In front of everybody?
At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?
I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
That's what she said. Pam?
That's what she sai  Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.
When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.
No, I've seen the video.
No, I didn't. 
Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
Mmmhmm. Yes.
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
 Come on.
Mwah! 
You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.
It's... That's...
Okay.  Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
This guy does it all.
What?
So I'm not in trouble?
I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.
Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...
I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
I don't know about that.
Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point.  You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
Yes, your corner. Go.
Mmmhmmm.
They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person.  C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on.
Oooh!
I'm not worried.
You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.
