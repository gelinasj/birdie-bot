Morning Dwight.
No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.
Well, yeah...
It worked.
I don't mind if I do.
I'm taking one for my lady friend.
Brain food. Thank you very much.

Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your "Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I don't really see them together". So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine. Take with food.
Yeah--
I think everyone has meet Helene. Shall we?
No, that wouldn't be--
Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
Hey--
Please, Kevin. You're fired.  Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots. Shall we go?
Just want you to succeed Pammy. You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.
Today is about family.
Hello. Scott. Table for four.
What table should we take? So many to choose from.
What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow!
Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it.
Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.
Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books.
That's funny.
You're 54 years old.
You're 58 years old?
Congratulations.
The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle. If anything I am robbing the grave.
 That--
Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
Helene?
I am. I'm definitely going to do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. Just need to learn how to swim. Come on, you in?
So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done.
Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.
You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping?
Snowboarding?
I might.
 Nothing. Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.
Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to.
So we should get the check?
Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it.
Yes you will.
I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper.
That's just an arbitrary title.
It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.
Oh that I plagiarized I think.
Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.
That was a bunt.
Oh, just went to the bathroom.
I got thirsty.
Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly. And then I met Helene. And she is great and she already knows and has done everything that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it. But, I think I want to do those things myself.
Finish your cake, Helene.
I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible I need to tell you. I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much. But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.
No it's not.
Wow. That just-- you've really grown.
 Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.
And I want kids. And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
It's not my decision. It's mother nature. And mother has very strict rules about fer--  -- tility.
Well, hobbies--
Pamela Beesly Halpert--
May I have a word with you in my office please?
Well, this is a work related matter.
Yes.
Yes. Join me please, won't you?  I am going to give you a raise.
Because of all the good work you've done.
That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude.
Do you want the raise or what?
Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
What?
 Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?
Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
See you.
Hey.
Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking--
What punch?
I'm pretty sure we said slap.
I-- mmm-- I'm good.
Hey.
Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
Really?
She strong?
Can you stop this?
Okay.
I don't either.
Mmm-hmm. I know.
You gotta do something--
How much time do you think you'll need?
Come on, man!
Am I scared of getting hit in the face? No. Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege. I'm scared I'm gonna love it.  Let's do this.
It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home.
You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn?
Yes.
I know.  Oh-- God!
Okay!  Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.
So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose.
Maybe that--
Yes.
Okay. I promise. 
No!
I don't know.
As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes. And guess what? I have four kids. And I have a hover-car and a hover-house. And my wife is a runner and it shows. And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together. And I am happy and I am rich and I never die. It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me.
Ahh... 
Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight.
No.
What are you talking about--
Forget that.
No.
 Oh that feels better.
