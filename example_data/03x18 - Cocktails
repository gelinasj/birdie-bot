Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
And now, the chains.
A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage.  Can he do it? I don't see how he can.
No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. 
AHHHH!
Yes.
I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...
Alright.
Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
Pam, would you smell my breath?
"Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?" Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.
Jimbo, last chance to carpool.
Sure? Might be a good idea.
Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
Play some games?
I spy?
Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going?  Heh-woh you.
Hey, Buttercup.
I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
That's what she said.
Uh, yes you are.
No problem. 
Ok.
Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...
Ummm... I don't know.
Maybe.
Ok.
Alright. Bye.
Beauty. Thank you sir!
Thank you.
Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
Yes.
Ok.
Hi.
Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.
Oh, um, potato salad.
No, it's not.
Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.
What are you looking for? You bring dip?
Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
Over our love.
You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
It's a heart.
I love this woman!
Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...
Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
Ok.
It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?
I could go for an appeteaser.
Bagel bites or something.
Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.
David, how much did this house cost?
Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. 
Yeah. Do you have any ice?
How about some Splenda?
This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
Crazy.
Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
What are you doing?
Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
What has gotten into you?
No, no, no.
Come on, let's go back to the party.
Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
Whatever.
That's all, you didn't mean it?
I love you, Jan.
