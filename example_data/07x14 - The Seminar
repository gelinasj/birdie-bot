 Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.
English?
Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?
I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi... It's called Reginald Pooftah.
Michael Scott.

I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!
No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
That's good. Pleasure to meet you.
Dunder Mifflin.
No, not right now.
All right. See you around.
Bye-bye. What a nice guy.
 Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.
Okay.
I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character "Mikanos", is just a little added flava. "Mikanos" is loosely based on another character I do, "Spiros", who is more about the ladies.
You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and...
Okay.
Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.
 If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos?
Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today.
Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.
 Practice Olympics.
 I like the musical "Grease", or as we call it, "home".
 Hello.
She will have a greekaccino.
It...
 I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk!
No more brain damage!
 All, you have to close right now.
No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.
Andy, what's the problem?
You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close.  What is taking that guy so long?
 No, no, no.
 Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
What? Come on. It's time for grapes.  Real fun day.
