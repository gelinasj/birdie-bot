Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long.  Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
Hey, Dwight.
You all right Ryan?
Pam!
That's what she said!
Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.
That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
Insult.
 But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a s*x Ed class.
Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?  The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
I do. Both of them.
No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
 Congratulations.
You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.
He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.
Yeah.
All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice.  All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
Well, it's mostly made up. So...
Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
Confidence, Dwight.
It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.
Dwight, they called your name.
All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you.  All right!
Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot.  Michael Winslow, anyone?
Car starting.  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.
Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
I got thirsty. How'd it go?
You would not believe what happened here.
Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'
She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?
