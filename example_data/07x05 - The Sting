Look at that.
Nice!
She is a beaut!
Oh, look at that.  Smooth roll.
Oh, god!
Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.
I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you.  Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
 Oh, my god!
Ow!  You never forget. Whoo!
Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea- Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?
Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up?
It's Jim, Okay? Yes.
You need the big guns, yes?
I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight.  Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
 No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?
No! Okay.  All right.
Oh, no, that's a male model.
That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?
All right.
Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--
Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.
When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it's Michael Scott. We've been together forever and we-
You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends.
And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now.
Shake it, shake it!
Okay. Thank you.
Thanks, Steve.
Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested.  Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door?
How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.
You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?
Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?
Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic.  See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?
Oh, my god!
You know what this is? This is a stinger.
Like the movie.
Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers.
Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.
Yes.
Oh, no, no. No. Don't-
Testify.
Yeah, he is that good-looking.
Okay.
Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.
Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.
Stay-
Oh!
Don't let us down.
No, no, no....
I'm goin 'in!
Stop, stop! Oh, my god!  Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
A surveillance room next to this one.
Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.
Well-
Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop.  You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.
So, you will?
Hold it, hold it.  Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
I know, I know.
Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!
O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.
Yes.
No, you may not.
I said no.
We're not-
Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave.  Don't leave. Don't let him.
Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.
No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.
He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
Good-bye!
This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.
