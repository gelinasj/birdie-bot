Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight?
Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad!  Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
All right, happy Friday.  Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
Hello.
Come on in. Good to see you.
Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
Yeah.
Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
Except driving.
Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
Okay.
Totally your call babe.
Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
Well, thats...
Yep, never been used.
No.
This is it, check that out, can you smell that? 
As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.
Bond.
James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. 
Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
Well, I-
Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. 
I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out.  Voila, right in the wall.
Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
I'll get it.
Okay.
Very nice.
When in Rome.
Whatever you say babe.
All right.
How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.
Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
Yeah that sounds good.
You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
All right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
Yes, I was watching Jim's face.
And he was laughing.
Look at him, he's laughing.
Well you don't need two of you to do that.
That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
No, Baah! But he's married to her!
No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
No!
God, does anybody read the paper?!
You're welcome.
I don't like that story babe.
Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!
. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.
Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that?
I'm sorry.  What now?
Dwight is my friend.
You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? 
 Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.  Hey, looks great babe.
You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
Excuse me for a second. 
Ok... alright... here we go.  Oooookay.
Everybody enjoying their meal?
Yeah?
No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
 Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!

You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.
Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
Would she get into trouble?
I will take the fall. I did it.
Jim? Pam?
No.
Nope.
