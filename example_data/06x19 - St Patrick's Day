Hello hello. Top of the morning to you! Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra!  Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.
It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.
Morning, honey-pile.
It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
Yes it is!
No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
Mm, that sounds great, actually.
When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!
That is a great idea JB.
Oscar, homosexual accountant.
Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...
Okay.
Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!
Well, I am heading down there.
How about July 4th weekend? 
I did!
You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch.
No is not an option.
All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
 I'll be over there.
Very nice.
A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?
Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
Okay. All right.
Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
Right. What?
Mm. mm. Oh well.
No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish.  Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
Hey Pack-man.
How you doing stud? You already there?
How's the lady situation?
Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
Yeah. Maybe next year.
How late do we have to work tonight?
Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?
Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.
Hello Jo.
There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.
I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day.  And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
Yes.
Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!
Drinks are on me!
Oh -hoh! All right.
Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something: Do I even like her? As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, "Don't worry, be happy."
Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever.  What the hell is going on back there?
