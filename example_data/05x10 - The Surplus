Mmm... okay.
Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
Yes.
There's the x-ax...icks.
Mmhmm, okay.
Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
Ho-oh!
Yeah.
I'll be six.
So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
 Whoo.
Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...
Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please...  Can anybody guess?
No, a new copier!  Unless everybody can agree on something better?
So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.
Alright, so, teams forming.
You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
Yes.
Why me?
Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
Yes.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
Yes.
Ohh, God!
Yeah!
Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
All right! Cool!
I have no idea.
 Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh, hey.
I do.
it was fun. We had a good time.
Oh, thank you.
Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
Nine dollars. The boys' department.
Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
Look at that.  Unh. Unh-unh.
Yes they were.
They were.
Mmhmm.
Sits on a copier.
Yeah.
Very valid.
All right.
See ya.
 Hahaha!... well...
Okay.
Oh, thank you my dear.
Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...
There he is! Hello, hello!
Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
Mm!  Yeah!
Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
Oh... ah, I almost choked.
Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.
Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue.  Yeah, take as many as you want.
Yes.
Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
It is, yes.
What?
Okay.
Oh, there we go.
Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
So, the copier.
All right, yes.
Well, what should I do?
All right, get out. Get out.
Hey David-  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling-  I'm sorry.
Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.
The what now?
...Like a tip?  $645?!
I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
All right, attention everyone.
I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is...  working perfectly.
Pam, would you stand up for a sec?  Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
Do I know what?
Mm, no...
$645.
Right.
Because that is how my mind works.
Let's see...
I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
This is so stupid.
This is so, so stupid. And, God...  that's my phone.
To be continued!
No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
 You think it's easy?
Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?
It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just-  Hey.
What?
Good work. I'm proud of you.  Mother-
 you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.
