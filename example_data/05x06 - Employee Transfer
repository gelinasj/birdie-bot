Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.
When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.
Road trip! Right?
Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
We're not.
We're not doing anything.
All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge.
Ah, you are quite the gentleman.
You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
Cool!
We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.
Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!  Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
Was I? Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
All right. What's the scoop, how far?
Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.
Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.
Here we go, fourth time's a charm. "Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there....  Hey. Are you crying?
Allergies?
Did Darryl touch you?
What's the matter?
Sure it is.
Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.
Listen to me. I like you so much.
And I've dated four women in the last--
Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
That's what she said.
Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.
Yeah.
Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way.
I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.
Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?
Years!
Yeah.
Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.
You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?
Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. 
I don't know what I'm gonna do!
Please?
I'm not gonna be okay.
No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.
You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you.
I'll be down in just a second.  Holly?
So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl  Goodbye.
We didn't break up.
Okay.
That's a really pretty song.
Okay.
