Still not seeing the problem here.
It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
Hi. 
Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.
Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.
And it also helps if you've had five shots.
Whoa!
Is Packer here?
 Don't know, don't care.
 Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. 
 Let's look at this.
Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
No!
Best day ever. Best day ever!
Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
Please.
Yeah, You love him right?  You love him. I can tell.
No. Not me, him.
Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...
He's funnier than me.
So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
 Uhm...
That's insane!
And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. 
I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
Yeah.
I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.
No it isn't.
Yeah, a little bit.
I won't.
 Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
Kevin, do you accept the apology?
Okay, go back to the annex.
That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy.  Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
What are you doing?
I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?
Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?
You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
Yes, about that.
Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
No, nothing like that at all.
Sorry?
 Sounds great.
That is.  It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
Nah, he's an ass.
 You ahh.
No you ahh.
 You ahh.
