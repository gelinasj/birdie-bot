Someone is returning! He started his own company, and now he's back. Who could it be? I'll give you a hint. He is a man. A man you have missed with all your heart. A man who has ruined all other men for you. Who is it?
 Hold it up. Conference room, five minutes.
Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  And how about casual Friday again, huh? Reinstituting casual Friday? You all look great. What I want to do right now is try something a little different. I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting. I want you guys to run it. I want you to say whatever you want, take it away. Your meeting.
If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
Yes.
Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different.
When I needed salespeople for my new paper company, everyone here turned their back on me. Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness? No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No. Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No. I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
Oscar, what were you going to say?
All right.
Not important.  Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
No, you lost those clients.
Okay.
Okay, Dwight. Let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay? And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department. It's a trash can.
 There you are, my friend.
Pamela.
Yep.
I know.
I do? Well--Where is that bowl?
Michael Scott Paper Company only.
Okay, well---
I will--no, no. I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
Against who?
The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott. They are in for a bitter surprise. I am not to be truffled with.
Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me. You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
That was us, right there.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, the Commish.
Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
Hey gang. Where you been?
Where'd you eat?
What'd you have, Stanley?
So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? Andy brought some salmon.
Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry?
I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
Mmm. Thanks for going out, guys.
Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight.
Who quits?
You guys gotta be kidding.
I love it. I love this idea, and I fully support you. As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.  There you go. There's some seed money for you. And you can take it, no hard feelings. But if you stay, I want an apology, and I want a big one.
Yes I do.
It's frontward's.
No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong. And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways. From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others. And the bottom line, I am in the wrong. I'm the bad guy.
I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
Whatever you guys did earlier.
Just do it, okay?
Get 'em there. Get 'em there.
Are you kidding me?
Okay, okay, okay.
So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say, "apology accepted", I think we would all feel better. And then we can break out my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
Okay. If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along.  However, I rescind my apology.
You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
 And Bingo was his name. Let's go.
I need your help. This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
You're close with Pam too.
Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.
I like his hair.
Okay.
That sounds pretty biased.
Okay. Pam, pros.
I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn't always follow through. Sh--New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice.
I don't need to tell you that.
I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.
Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.
Oh, wow! Whoa!
Ho-ho, man! Wow.  Honey! I want you to bring the garbage out. 'Cause I'm not going to have s*x with you unless you bring out the garba--
I have a very difficult decision to make. It's like last week I was at the video store. Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice? It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
Pam, can you come in here, please? Have a seat.  Well, there's no easy way of saying this. So I think I will just...drag it out. Since the dawn of time there has been--
I gave Ryan the sales job. There just weren't enough clients for the two of you. So I had to--
I'm sorry, sorry.
 Yes, you did.
Yep.
No, you--no.
No, you're the best person for the job. You're going to be great.
 Oh, oh!
You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
Oh, really?
Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good.
I don't know, I offered him his temp job back. We'll see. He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--
I don't appreciate you telling me what to do. So clean out your desk, you are through here.
Oh! What's our receptionists name?
Could you send her in?
Hello.
Have a seat.
This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  Hank, could you come up here please? Hank is our security guard--
He will be ushering you out. 
Oh, your face! Oh!
No, I'm kidding. No, you're not--you're not fired. Yet.
Oh...
I don't know, actually.
