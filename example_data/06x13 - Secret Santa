Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. 
What the hell is going on?
Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?
Phyllis?
Take it back. That is absurd.
No? No! Jim! Come on!
It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!
Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.
If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably "freedom." At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore.
 Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
No it's not, not like penis-wise.  Hello little boy, what's your name?
Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go.  Oh my God.
What would you like for Christmas little boy?
What did you think was going to happen?
All right, just say "some toys" please.
Damn it Kevin, come on.
Okay get off, get off!  Oh! Oh, God!
Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.
Ryan come here!
Come on, come on.
Ahhh... Ho ho ho!  Come on I need this. Come over here!
Just sit down!
Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
Whoop! Okay, what?
Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!
Do you understand, you forced my hand?
Oh, do we? Do "We?" Is that what "we" want? Why don't "we" take a vote on it?
Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--
No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?
I'll get some punch. That looks delicious. 
I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. "Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself." That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me? Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me.
Behold!  Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget.
Oh the Anti-Christ!
Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?
Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
 Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?
Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend!  Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
 Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?
 Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley.
 I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up.
 That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
 No!
 Andy had Erin.
 What? Turn it back on.
David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as.
I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.
What?
Really? What's going on?
What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!
What does that mean?
Well, can't Alan protect you?
All of us?
Oh my God.
Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.
Hey. How's everybody doing?
That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
I don't want to say. But, "it's fun to stay at the -" 
"It's fun to stay at the -"

You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas. And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "How could they do this to us?"
It's not... Nevermind. Nothing. 
I didn't say anything!
We're going out of business!
David told me on the phone. David told me.
Earlier today.
He said, we have been sold. 
Dwight! Jesus!
David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.
It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith.
I'll call him. I'll call David.
Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I'm a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom.
It's not sweetie, it's Michael Scott.
Stephanie could you hop off please?
David!
David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned.
Well I think we're past that now.
We're not fired?
Yeah!  It's a Christmas miracle!
Woo hoo! 
Oh! You got it? What is that? 
Huh. Well, maybe those will help. 
Hi Santa.
I'd like to make a wish.
I would like an Xbox, and a TV that's compatible with an Xbox. And, I'm sorry.
You called Bob?
Come on! Phyllis!
Okay.
Oh God. Get a room Santas!
Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays.
