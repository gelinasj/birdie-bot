Oh! God. Dwight, come on...
There's no downsizing.
Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?
But there's no downsizing, so just don't...
Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.
It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "You're fired."  "You're foir-ed." I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, "You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want." But that's unrealistic, so...
Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
Who is it? Who's the birthday?
Next person on the...
...calendar.
Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.
Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
 Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.
These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!
So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so...
Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?

 Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.
Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?
Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?
What?
Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so...
 Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
 Which one is that again?
Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.
Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
It's surprise Meredith. One, two...
Find a key.
And many more!
You were surprised, weren't you?
You looked freaked, man. We said "Surprise." You were, like, "What?" "What the hell's goin' on here?" Good cake. Why don't you have some?
Come on. A little bit.
Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.
You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good.
Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.
Is Oscar around?
I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...
I know...
Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?
How many miles did he do last year?
Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
 I don't know about that.
 Huh! Thanks, downer.
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
 You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... "Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
Divorce. Um... OK, "Meredith is so old..."
Everybody? If... could do it? "Meredith is so old..."
"She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her."
That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me.
This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that.
OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25.
Per mile, yes.
When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.
A check for the kids, and for the team.
I want it to be like... "Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous." "Well, guess what,  that was Michael Scott." "But it was anonymous, how do you know?" "Because I'm him."
Come here.  Don't cash that till Friday, OK?
