 Hey, you ready?
All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan.  Very good. Excellent, excellent.
Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, "This might be kinda fun." And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
 When I let him come to my pick-up game...
 I vouched for you.
I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.
Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager.
No, it's not. It's lower, so...
All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right.
And here we have "Mister Roger's Neighborhood." Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.
And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
 And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport!
So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on.
Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.
Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. 
All right, see you at one.
Are we ready for the game?
I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.
Uh,  "I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword."
OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
Um, what do you play? Center?
Uh...
Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.
Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.
 Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
Yes.
Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
No.
No, no, ridiculous.
Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.
Sorry Phyllis.
No, I'm team captain.
No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.
No.
Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now.
Threat neutralized.
 Off the backboard!
Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
Oh, yeah right.
Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.
Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
What?
OK. Cool, you're on.  Don't screw this up.
 Classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game.
Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you're fired. That's a joke. OK, let's do it.
All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
OK.
OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy.
Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.
Aw, come on Dwight.
On. Just put it on.
Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK?
Stanley! What? You gotta be kidding me! !?!  Who's on him? Somebody get him!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here.  Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone!
Who's got Roy? 
 Dwight, I was open. All right, let's go.
 OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That's a foul.
OK, I'll take it.  OK.
When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone.
 What is wrong with me today?!
Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, that's probably gonna happen, actually.
Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut!  Whoa!
That is cool. Is that like the Robot?

Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
You know what? Dwight, Dwight...
Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like...  Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah...
 Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter...
All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!
What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls.
All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.
Shoot, shoot it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression! Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up.
 Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?
 Yes!
 Watch the long passes, you guys!
Dwight!
 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what's the score?
Yeah, baby, here we go!
 Ow! God! Hold it!
Foul! Foul!
Oh, that hurts.
What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.
 Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair.
Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly.
Thanks Dwight.
Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won.
It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
Um... well, you guys, you know, I'm the boss so...
Hey, hey...
 You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.
Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.
Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.
The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead.
