It's 4:30 in the morning. Do you know where your kids are? If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do. They're gonna be in this van. With me. Who am I? Nothing to fear. I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
 De-nied!
Hello! Time to make the donuts! Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  Hey Pam.
Milk and sugar.
That's what I said.
Every morning.
We're, uh, we're doing okay. A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun. Uh, yep. We have 20-- of those.
You know what we need? We need some couches in here.
Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
Like in a dorm room. You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top. You can sleep up top.
Most do in the magazines.
We should look into that. Or we just go for the loft.
How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
They are correct, sir.
Okay. A lame attempt at humor. Swing and a miss.
Lowest in town.
Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
Explain that.
Well, we don't--
Whatever, yeah.
Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
Just crunch 'em. Just crunch 'em please.
Hi, Jerry. Michael Scott. Well, this is slightly embarrassing.  Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday. Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.
Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
I know. But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. It's this.
I would love that.
Was it nice?
I love Pad Thai.
No. There's a lot I haven't done.
 Hmm?
We're not hiring, Jim.
Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.
Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--
No-- We don't have--
 Uh... Yes.
Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
That's a pun.
Yep. Oh... wow.
Of course not.
Nope, nope, nope.
Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.
Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it.
Ah...
I'm good, I'm good.
It is. I'm good.
Hello.
Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace. I believe we're expected.  Well, well, well. How the turntables...
And we are prepared to reject that offer.
Never accept their first offer. What is your second offer?
Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.
I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you.
 We'll have to talk--
Just amongst ourselves.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
We are so rich.
No.
It's a lot of money, okay. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
Agreed?
Shut up, shut up. Hello?
I want my old job back. I want my old parking space back. I want a Sebring.
And I want Charles gone.
I need him gone.
Okay, then I want Pam back.
Sales.
Yes, she is. At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
And Ryan.
You know, David. I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
And dental this time.
These are our demands.
Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names.
That's one of 'em! Yes. These are our demands. This is what we want. Our balls are in your court.
Can we have the room please?
Yes! Can you believe it? That's what I'm talking about!
There are certain defining moments in a person's life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin. What have I learned from all of this? It is far too early to tell. I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it. I just want to enjoy it.
No, no. You're done.
