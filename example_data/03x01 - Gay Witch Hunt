No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody "faggie". Why would anybody find that offensive?
That's what faggie means!
It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
Exactly!
Yeah, I know.
OK, a little too far, crossed the line.
I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't... You don't call retarded people "retards". It's bad taste. You call your friends "retards" when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend.
Listen man, I am so sorry. I had no idea.
No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people "faggie" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
Can you tell who's gay and who's not?
What about Oscar?
Well, he is.
 There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.
Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman.
I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?
Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.
That's ridiculous.
 Let's call him and get the website.
Well, they're sold out.
I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so...
What? What does that even...
Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival.
I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?
I don't kn--
Anything's possible.
 Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer?
 Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay p0rn, straight p0rn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful.
 All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW!
Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.
We're all homos! Homosapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you.
Who should be the judges and juries of our society?
Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey s*x as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right?
That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  See? Everybody has a chance!
But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do!
 And I take that as a compliment.
Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---
No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero!
No no no. The only signal that I am sending is: Gay, good.
Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.
You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend ---
...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!
All right, um... sorry.
 I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.

 Oh come on! Dwight! Come on, man!
We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love... anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar... and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?
I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. ...that's what she said. Or he said.
Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows?
