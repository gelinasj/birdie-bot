Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.
 Narc!
I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
Uuf, well...
 Okay...
Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God!  I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin?
Remember the narc bit?  Uh-oh, who's in trouble?
Waa... what? What are you talking about?
Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.
Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
I can do that, it is my office.
Hmmm. Ha.  Alright. Great.
It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs."
I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
Yes it is.
Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down?  In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam.
Really? 
Jim it's okay. You can t...  Okay, well.
The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
Yes, I will not be.
Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
Just forget it. Just the urine.
Just. I need your urine.
Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
It's none of your business.
Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
I need clean urine for the lady.
Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes
A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
What's wrong? Where's your costume?
Why? Wha...
Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
Yes, sir.
So you wanna? Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
No. Oh. Uh...
Alright.  Well, Thank you.
