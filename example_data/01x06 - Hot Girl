Affirmative.
You just said, let me uh... check my notes. You just said...
Hey, hey how is Alan? Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!
Okay
Uh, huh.
Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?
Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to...
I didn't mean me!
Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing.
Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid.
Pam!
Burger with cheese!
And fries!
And shake! What? Go ahead.
No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.
Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away.
 Oooh, alright I'll talk to her.
All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.
Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?
Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.
Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm against violence in the workplace.
Nobody cares what you think.
So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day.
Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.
I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.
This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall.  used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.
So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.
Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks.
It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here.
Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb
No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?
Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.
 There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe.
I have an idea. Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?
You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.
Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.
I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?
I know, it's unbelievable.
Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby.
Toby, Katy.
Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?
You and your wife, and you have kids.
Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
Okay. Alright. Cool. See ya in a bit.  Oh, she's cute. Cutie-pie. Back to work.
I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike.
Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?  So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?
Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
Busted.
Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.
Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!
Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!
 What? What's the matter?
Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?
Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
Seriously. No, really.
God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp.
I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves.
What?
Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.
Excellent.
Great. Cool. Cool.  Yeah, okay.
I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---
No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not.
But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...
No. I cannot promise you that.
Listen, Dwight.

Espresso?
You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
Ummm-hmmm...
Very easy to clean.
Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? 
Did we get any mail?
Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...
Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
Ryan.
Would you like to help me with a special project?
Alright.
 Okay, just throw out all the empties.
Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.
No.
Uh, what flavor?
Blue's not a flavor.
Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.
What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir.
No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.
Not it's not, there's some in the straw.  There, now you may throw it out.
That's over several months, Ryan.
I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face.  I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right? I don't know.
Sure you don't want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem.
See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.
Where you going?
With us?
Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
Alright, have fun.
Don't drink and drive.
Take it easy.
You too, have a good night.
Do I have a special someone? Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.
