 I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint...
I'm looking for the toy drive box.
OK... Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
Umm... I don't know? Average kind?
Well, that is probably from the test drive.
No.
Oh, thanks. 
Yes?  Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.
OK. Did everybody get one of these?
Terrific. Good.
This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her.  I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.
There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello 
Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side.
Turn around, turn around. Come on. 
No, you get outta here.
Yes.
Thank you.
Not as much as I need a moment alone with you.  Berp.
That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
I know.
Right.
Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
And next to your kids. What?
I don't understand?
OK
No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in  Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.
I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
And it's all inclusive.
Yes.
No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.
Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.
Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.
Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
Fine!  Have your party. Just no guests.
Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
 Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?
Take it from Toby.
Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
It's all...  OK.
What are you doing? 
Carol?
I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.

This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.
All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
Hooters?
Ah, I need my entourage  Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.
Why not?
Ok, feel better.
C'mon Jim, let's go.
Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.
Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy.
Carol used to drink lattes.
She would get this little foam mustache...
And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny.
She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---
I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...
I'm just gonna call her.
Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.
Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. 
You're right. That's good.
I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef.  I see steak.
Excuse me  Family style.
I don't think... I love it!
 I don't know what he's doing.
You know what we should do?
We should invite them to the Christmas party.
Oh, you are such mench my friend. 
OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. 
The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours.
Oh.  That's what she said.
Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
 The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room.
Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.
We're going to ...
I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos.  is do you agree?
Do you agree about what?  Wow. You're lucky you're so darn cute.
What're you talking about?
When you know, you just know.
Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
It's... it's one of those two. 
Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.
I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?
Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her.
Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile 
Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party.
Hey, hey, you. How are ya?
No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...
Where do you wanna go?
I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.
You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.
That waitress was the one.
How can you be sure?
Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.
I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.
I, I put a mark on her arm.  So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!
Oh, why do I feel like crap?
I had rebound? Yeah.
I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.
 Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive...
