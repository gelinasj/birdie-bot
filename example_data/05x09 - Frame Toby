Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?
Heh, okay, weirdo.
She said she was going to give it to him right now. 
Yeah, they used to.
Oh, can you imagine?
Uhhgh.
I don't know. What?
Hmmm, dare I? 
NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
 Look at him. With his stupid face. Stupid... tan. No.
No.
He looks worse.
Uh, well I'm afraid not. Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.
Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
Yes.
I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls. Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
That's true. People say it's icky.
David, wait.
Is there no way we can get rid of him?
I have cause. It is be-cause I hate him.
No.
I don't.
 Don't do that.
You want to see some really high caliber acting? Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served.  Hey Toby, great to have you back, man. Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
You're welcome. Missed you. Missed you as part of our family.
So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun.
Nice beaches, pristine beaches?
Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay?
I bet, for you.
 Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
Yeah, I am. I am.
I tried, I tried. I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail. I feel like I'm dying inside. I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II. She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends. I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
Okay, just summarize.
That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started.
What are you doing?
For what?
No, no, no.
You're the bait for Toby?
No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me.
Yes, sure they do, Dwight.
Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
Oh, oooh his mistress. No. I'm kidding. No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson? I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits. Do not read it beforehand. Can you do that for me?
Good.  N-no no no, don't.
Pam. Pam, you gave me your word.
Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
Toby can I see those? Ooh.  What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared?
You mad? You mad at me?
Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
Huh? He might do it...
I dare you to. Come on.
What's the matter... haaaww!
Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?
No do it, do it. I dare you.
Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon...
Son of a bitch.
 Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day.
What's that?
Frame him?
I've never framed a man before, have you?
Just seems awfully mean. But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
Hello. I've seen you guys around. I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. How you doing?  Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here? I need to purchase something.
No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...
Grass, weed?
I heard you drug--- I heard you dealt.
I'm not wearing a wire, so...
How much? How many pounds is it?
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot... I forgot...
Those are real cops, real guns. I wonder what's going on. 
Uh, you know what? I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?
No, no no no... No, no.
No, that was... that was legitimate. That was totally legitimate.
Oh God!
No, no no no no.
God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is. And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!
Ahh, that's mine.
Yes, it's mine.
Are you kidding me? That's my salad.
You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
Hmm.
Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about? You're... you're worried about the cop's time? You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer? Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us. So...
Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
Do you want to hear a lie?
I think you're great. You're my best friend.
