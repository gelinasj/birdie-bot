Pam?
Pam? Knock, knock.
I know you are. Knock, knock.
 4-9-1-7-4-5-1
They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. 
Buddha.

I, I need something to wipe my hand.
That was helping. It was classic.
No... God.
Alright.
Who's there?
KGB - 
What the hell was that? 
What are you doing?
You, you like that?
Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
 Who's there?
Dwight, get the door.
Answer the door.
I'm not gonna answer it
Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
Why thank you very much.  Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine.  Umm hmm.
Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
No, you don't. No, it -  What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
Woo hoo.
Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...
...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
Invite them on the tour.
Really? That's kind of a big client.  Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
Yeah?
Yeah.
I thought I did. So...
Well no harm no foul.
You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.
Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
Irrelevant.
OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. 
Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?
No, they can't.
Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.
Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -
Thank you, Jim is with me.
Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess.  Yes.
OK, don't get that. Please? 
That is not constructive.
 Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--
How are you doing?
 My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.
I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
You're breaking up.
OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
Yes.
No.
 Yes.
 Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
Woah, wow, who told you that?
 No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
I'm not taking... I'm not taking...
Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
Yes I do. You've just never seen it.  March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
Why do you have a diary?
OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
Yes, you did.
What are you writing? 
Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--
Umm, nacho chips.
Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
 It's not ready yet.
I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.
Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.
He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
Right.
That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...
You kind of have.
Yes.
 Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?
Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?
Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight?
Give me the details of how that happened.
What?
David? David?
David?
Could I be a part of the meeting also?
There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
Oh how dare you.
You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
Oh please.
Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
Thank You!
Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
I want to see it.
I want to see it. 
Give me... Give me the diary.
