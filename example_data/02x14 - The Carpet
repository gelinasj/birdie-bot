Spamster!
Hamster.
Welcome back! How was your vacation?
Yeah?
Did you get lucky? Oh! Boink!
I am Pam. Spicoli guy. Oh, God. Names, numbers. Okay.  Whoa! God! Yuck, yuck. Yuck. Yuck!
Wow! What happened in there?
There is stink in there, my God! What is... what is that?
Is it a bird?
Oh, God! How could that happen? How could... right in the middle of the carpet.
Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
Check it out.
Check it out. Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee.
What is it?
What is it? No, just tell me what it is.
I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
How do you know that? What is it, then?

That is worse.
, I can't stay in here another second. No!
 Hey Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
Oh... It's ...
 Yeah ...
No, no, no! Seriously, I don't mind sharing.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen.
Don't ape me.
This is great.
The pressures of my office are insane.
I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here.
Yeah.
Ed Truck.  Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us. Stop having fun. Start pretending to do work." What a jerk. He's... You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.
You know who used to sit at that desk?
Mm-mm. Todd Packer.
Yeah.
He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes.
When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office . Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that they were crazy.
I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.  Okay.
Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired.
Charley horse!
Charley horse!
Oh, okay. Gah.
Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office.  It was hysterical.
 Dwight.
Let's send up Accounting.
Old fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah. Follow my lead.
Hey guys.
Ahem. What's up?
Yeah! Oh ho ho 
No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that.
Watch out, Pam. You're next!
Maybe!
Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her.
You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense.
Stop.
Stop it.  Don't. Don't.
All right.
Hi, guys.
I'm just walking around.
Well, yeah.
Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?
 ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
God, this is gonna be fun.

 Nothing.
No. Just ...
You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just...
Yeah, paper business. Is this done?
Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. 
This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them.
You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today.
You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.
Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I... you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done .  Very well. Then you are all punished.
You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly. 
Do you remember Ed Truck?
How would I know?
My biggest fear is turning into him.
 I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you?
 Ed? Hi. Thanks for meeting me. Must be kinda neat comin' back.
Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.
Oh, no, no, no. You're good. It was clerical. You're good. Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
Really?
Well, that figures. So how did you deal with people not liking you?
Well... s-sure I can.
Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father.
Well, okay. Different management styles.
Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends. Go get yourself a monkey kidney."
 Yes.
Who is this? How did you get this number?
Oh my God. Packer. Packster. Whacky Pack. How you doin'?
Uh... no. Did anybody see a package here today? No. How big was it?
Really?
Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it?
Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office?
Are you kidding me? Oh!
That was Packer! Oh, you're... you are dead. You are dead, my friend! That is hilar... Oh, God! Of course it was you.
Oh.  Yeah, yeah! Oh my God. It was Packer!
It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don't expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people. We have fun.  We just have fun! Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out.
