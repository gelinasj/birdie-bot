I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success.
I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy.
 And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.'
You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
Do I look okay?
Hi.
Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?
Oh- She's not here?
A.J.
She has a boyfriend.
How could she do this to me, Pam?
I can't do the presentation, I can't- 
I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay? 
And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.


I can do this.
Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper" and get them to "Show us the money!" Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen.  Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name?
A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?
What do you race cars?
Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?
Huh- 
It's all connected. Shut up.  Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?'
 Does it feel good?
 Ooh, okay.
Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.
No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right.  Okay... okay.

Want some pie?
I went through Holly's things.
I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
I also stole something off of her computer. A document called "Dear Michael."
I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.
No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it.
Yes.
How?
I know, I know. You're right, you're right.
No, that wouldn't-
No, you don't have to do that.
Okay. 
Well?
She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
You're sure?
 Okay.
I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.
