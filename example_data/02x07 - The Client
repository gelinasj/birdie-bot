Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today.
I changed it. To Chili's.
Radisson just gives out this vibe, "Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson". It's kind of snooty. So.
Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course. It's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine.
It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor.
Uh huh, uh huh.  Power trip.
Ok, let's do this thing.  Wish us luck.
 Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now.
Well...
No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  Adios!
Uh, I'll drive.
It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?
At all!
You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
Dar de dar.
Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead.
We should come up with a signal of some sort.
Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
Well, I... it could be either of us.
Yeees.
Hello? Christian?
Thought that was you. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
No Gould?
Uh, Jan, what happened?
Is Gould dead? What uh-
Wow, you're kidding me! Do you wanna talk about?
When did this happen?
Ok.
Alright, after you.

Awesome blossom.
 I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say? They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
Ok, it's done. Actually,  Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome? Now it's done.
I heard a-
Very very funny joke the other day. Wanna hear it?
Ok.
Just one joke. Ok. Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke. Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.
Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
Yes.
No.
Nope. Told it. Not as good as you think. Pick another one.
Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning?
First guy says "Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn". And the second guy says, "Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort". And the third guy says "I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe".
 That's delicious! I love it!
Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words. That's her fault.
Did somebody say "baby back ribs"? Hmmm? Hmmmmm?

 Chili's baby back ribs...
Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
Oh, so you're not gonna play? She's not playing.
She's not playing the game.
Check please.
No, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid. Right?
You know?
It's true.
Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.
It's bad.
It, you know what, it really is.
Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?
 See ya.
We did it!
Nailed it. Nailed it! Come here.
What!?
Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go.  Oh-ok.
Morning, Pam. Hey.
No, nothing happened. I-I swear, nothing happened. What, I'm, totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I.  No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all. It's off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So.
Hello, Dwight.
Who.
Uh, no, no, no Gould.
This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.  Is that all?
I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no. I didn't slip you something!
