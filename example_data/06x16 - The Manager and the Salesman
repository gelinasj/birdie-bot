Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America! I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.
Okey doke.
What?
No.
No.  We're trying to look it up right now.
Um, come on.
Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.
Oh.
That's it!
Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.
Okay, put it on my card.
Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?
 Why hello!
Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.
Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.
Whoa, whoa!
And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
Forget the question...
I humbly accept the management position.
Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.
Yes.
No, we know. Texas!
I could manage my way around that.
I will try to manage my excitement!
I have been saying the word "manager" a lot, so whenever Jo thinks "manager" she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a pen1s. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a pen1s. And vise-versa.
Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
What?
What? Really?
Wow!
La la la, hello Oscar!
What are you reading?
Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
Why, is there an untapped gay market?
...Where did you get that information.
Manuel who?
Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.
Son of a bitch.  Pardon me.
Okay.
Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.
Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.
No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.
I'm turning myself in right now!
Thank you.
Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
How is that possible?
No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.
Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers?  Michael Scott, head of sales.
 I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called "Curves." I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!
Why not? It's part of the sales experience.
Well, okay...
What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?
No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?
You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
No, this is geological.
Are you kidding me?
And you guys are okay with this?
Oh my God.
Hey.
You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.
Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.
I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
We make a poster that says "Happy Opposite Day!" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.
Lethal Weapon?
What? What I'm saying...
And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys?  See? They love me.
Alright!
Oh, it smells good in here.
Erin, what about my keyboard?  Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?
