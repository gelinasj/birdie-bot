Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me.
Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.
Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.
Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it.  It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.
 Are these numbers correct?
Okay.
Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out.
Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. 
Oh, yeah.

 Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?
Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.
What, are you talking about me and Holly?
Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.
Thank you.
All right.
Okay. Fine. No more PDA.
You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
Anything goes.
Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?
Pro.
What? Problem solved.
No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.
Ah, the old "leave behind." Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.
Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.
Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.
Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day.
I love you.
I love you-love you.
I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. 
Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.
Hello, Holly.
Here, shake. No!
No, we can't.
No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.
Oh.
Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.
I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.
Grab you here.
I will grab you here anyway. 
Never.
I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
Yes, it was that. It's that one.
We're not supposed to PDA.
I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.
That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different?
I was in love with you.

It's like a time bomb...
...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.
Sexual time bomb.
 Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
No.  Saving the world has never been this hard.
No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.
Do the monkey face.
I love that. I love that face.
No. The monkey!
Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.
That's good.
That's good. He's throwing it.
I know.
Holly. Hey.
Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.
Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's...
Who?
Okay. Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay!  Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.
I do.
What are our plans for tonight? Umm...
