Hey, mon!
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.
Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
It was so good. Oh, Hey mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says "Hey mon," everybody says "Hey mon" back.
Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna...
You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.
Feelin' hot, hot, hot!  Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing.
You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.
Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
Inventory's at the end of December.
I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?
Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
The Jamaicans don't have a word for "impossible."
How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.
Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign?  "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem." This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.
No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.
Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. s*x. We had s*x. I had s*x with her. I had s*x with Jan.
 Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.
Oh no?
OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
Check it again. Hit refresh.
OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at...  Packer@DunderMifflin.com. Packaging@DunderMifflin.com. Uh oh.
Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl?
OK, Hey, man, how's it going?
That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging." Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
And you sent that out to everyone?
I have a special assignment for you.
A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."
Not important.
OK, forget it.
Not now, not ever.
Aww, none of your business.
That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.
This is probably the icebreaker you need.
I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.
No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
OK.
Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
She bought it?  OK. OK.
There an accident? Somebody hurt?
Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.
All right. 
Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---
No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...
My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?
Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! 
Hey.
Island living. You know?
Did she say what it's about?
There are copies in the bathroom?
All right.
Guh.
OK, yup.
I...
I... I... Yes.
OK, yeah.
Who is Dr. Perry? I...
And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...
Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate - 
Jan, you... complete... me.
