Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
Get back to work, Dwight. Please.
Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!
Who enjoys the weekends?  And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend. So just shout it out.
Okay.
Okay, you get out of here, big dog.  Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.
Oh!
That's fun.
All right.
We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.
Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "I wanna go to Mount Pocono," you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.
You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
... and... we had s*x, too.
How?
How do I not make any more of it?
All right.  And she won't say, "I love you."
Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
Yeah, she does all that.
No, no...
Run what?
Why didn't you just say that, Pam?
Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
That's what makes it so wrong.
Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.
 I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
This is you. How much do you charge?
I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
Okay.
It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
It's comfort food, all right?  God.
I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.
Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
God, this is so disgusting.
I know.
That's not true.  You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
Helene?
Oh.
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.

You're back. What happened?
No, what happened with Donna?
Ugh!
No. No! Are you sure?
Who eats eight protein bars?
Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
What? No, she didn't say that.
I am not paying for that membership.
 Ohhh... mmm...
No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
That's her?
Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right.  Okay, I'll talk to you later.
I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
Well, you are boner-ific. 
...poop my pants.
Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
We are?
Wow.  That's exciting.
Hey.
Well it can wait. It can wait.
Jim is her husband.
And they are having problems, so sh...
Good in bed.
Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
Okay, weirdo.
Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.
I have to hear it from her.
I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
I need to have her say...
I need to say, "What the hell is that? What the hell is that?"
No, God! No, no, oh, my God!
 Okay. Okay. Okay.
You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
Wouldn't that be fun?
How about Thursday?
I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.
Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
Nope, that's Tuesday.
You're cheating. You're cheating on me.
Pam told me. 
Who is he?
The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
I'm the mistress?
