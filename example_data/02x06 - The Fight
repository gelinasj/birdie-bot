 I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.
Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
 Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?
Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. "Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority." Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?
 Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
This is Tito.
Calling from... 
 Pick up.
 This is Mike Tyson.
And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.
Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.
Because I would kick his ass.
So? I've beaten up black belts.
They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.
And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.
You were a Jet?
Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me.  Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.
Just hit me. You'll see.
Oh, queer...  eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...
... he cried at the end of it. He did.
Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
Yeah.  Thank you.
 Go away.
I haven't signed them, ok?
Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.
Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.
Oh, so that's what they are saying?
Ok, alright, where is Dwight?
Ok.
Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
No, Really?
Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.
Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.
Really?
You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.
No, they must have class.
Look...
Hey, Toby.
I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.
I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
I think it is. A guy told me about that.
Oh.
Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
Hey!
What the hell was that?
No.
Alright, that's the way you want it.
Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.
I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
I got his pants.
Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot! 
Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. 
Open your mouth.
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? "Raging Bull." Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here.  Oh, we're playing phone tag.
My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
 Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.
 Yeah.
Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?
If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
Alright, bye.
Dwight?
This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
Well,  busier. Making the time.
Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.
I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.
No, no, title change only.
No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.
Absolutely but not really.
Yes you do.
And, ditto.
I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.
