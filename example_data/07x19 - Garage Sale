I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
500.
Get lost.
That is how you do it.
You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
In case... in case of what?
I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
Get lost.
 Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.
Hi.
Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.
Well, I'm writing a message.
I'm asking Holly a question in fire.
Maybe.
Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
Pam.
I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
No, this is romantic.
Why?
I did?
Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
Yes.
I could not have agreed with you more.
Yes. Thank you.
No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.
I had a great idea until you ruined it.
How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'
It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
Heres the ring.
Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
Is she not going to like that?
At a gas station?
That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
I just... it's terrifying.
I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.'
Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
Oh ok. For how long?
Is he alright?
You ok?
Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
Ok.
No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
Hey, how'd we do?
That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
This is where we first kissed.
And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.
In-grown hair.
Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
And over here..
Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. 
Let's go in here.
This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
That marriage would be a sham.
Easy no.
That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
Only one that I was kind of worried about.
 Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?
Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.
Yep.
Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.
