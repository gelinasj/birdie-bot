I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. 
Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.
Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.
Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.
I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.
Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
Well, could you condense it please?
It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.
They sent a limo.
Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.
 Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.
Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-
What?
The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.
 Mmm... whoa.
 I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here.
Definitely.
Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.
 Who's playing with the button?
I will have to answer.
No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.'  I won't say that. I'll something like that.
Oh, my god. This is it.
Yes.
Oh, hi.
Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.
Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -
See you later.
 Officers. Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello.
Thank you.
Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.
It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege.
Ah.  Your eminence.
You guys ever protect the president?
What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?
Rock and roll. 
 This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
 They are really angry.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -
Yes.
 I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -
Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track.  You. You.
Wow. Things are really picking up.
What?
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.
We tell them the plan, right?
Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.
Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
I am the guy who roused that crowd.
Got them on their feet.
They were so happy down there.
Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.
Well, I'm texting him, so.
It's done. 
Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away. 
Tell them what you told me. This is genius.
Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -
It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.
That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.
O-kay. Oh... hey, hey.  What are you doing?
Wow, man. That -
That was embarrassing.
For me, too. You embarrassed me.
Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.
Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.

Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.' That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks. Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.
 Oscar! Oscar! Come on! There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
