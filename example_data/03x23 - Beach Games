Ughh... Blech.
Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
Right there. 
Maybe.
Not it. I don't have eggs.
That's possible.
Uh-huh?
The CFO? Ohh...
OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
And Gromit.  Jan? Is Jan there?
Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
...you just gots to get your freak on.
Yeah.
Hmmm.
Really?
Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
May God guide you in your quest.
OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
Well, you can't swim in leather pants.  I'm just yankin' your chain. Not literally.
Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.
Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
This way to the partay bus.
Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
Well,  Hey Pam, did you get that down?
Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures.  Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg.  Watch out for snakes!
Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in.  Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
Just words. Inspiring words.  For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
I'm not playing.
Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
Then I will name your team the Red team.
I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.
It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! 

Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
Smart as a whip! Yes!  These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
Like umm... ten minutes?
Thanks a bunch.
A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
OK, who's hungry  For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.
Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
I can't say.
The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
 There we go. Let's see it.
Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
13 hot dogs, everybody!
It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright. It's alright. Here we go.
Aaaaaand, go!
Nice, Stanley!
One. Two. Three.
Excellent!
I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?
Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
Please just check.
What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
Pointless.
Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.
Ji.. why not? C'mon.
You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay.  Okay.
Yes. Count to three, please.
Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
Okay.
Don't, don't.
I'm not going to give it to you.
Being the boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. "Outside Hire."
Yeah. Ummm, hmm... True. Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
God! He's a comedian.
Who's Amanda Bynes?
Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
You are being too modest.
Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
That is a very, very funny story.
Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
