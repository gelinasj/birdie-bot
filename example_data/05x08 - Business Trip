Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment. In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite.
I am jetting off on an international business trip.
To Can-A-da.
Canada.
My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international. The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery...
Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.
I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket.  You are now sexy in your culture.
I have my passport. 
I have my per diem.  I already know what I am going to spend this on. I am going to buy a sweater.
Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.
And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best. Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine. I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
Well that is all in the past.
They have one of those?
 Lets do this!
Two are for souvenirs.
I do. It's right here. 
No, I don't want to wear a bra.
Stop it! Stop it!
Okay. Where is my translator?
There he is.
Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you  if you hadn't forgotten French. Where is my numbers man?
There we go. Our town car awaits.
Its not just a van.
Dwight, can you get those please?
 Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.
Handed to me as I sat down. This was my hot towel. It is still wet.
Take a sip of that. 
That good?
Don't drink all of it. Give some to Oscar.
You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
Yes, this is Beth. This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
Yes...
Get back, get back. Come on, get back to the slums.
 Hey... guys, check it out. My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.
Shhhh! Keep it down.
Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane?  My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
 Hi.
Um. I'd like to see a menu please.
Oh... okay.  GAH!
 This is nice. This is nice. Move in here. Very sweet... ah.
Alright.
Very cool.
Okay.
Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
Wow!
Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!
A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered.
Guys, she's in there.
Let's do this.
 Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott. Good to see you again.
Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.
Works in accounting. This is uh, concierge Marie...
...who works at our hotel. You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---
She's foreign. I am--
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Andy.
Everyone is going to end up dying someday. And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with.
How about this one? It's Christmas eve---
---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do? What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
Unbelievable! Unbelievable.
 Do you want to get some breakfast or something?
Okay.
Slept like a baby.
Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here. They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter. They are treated like human beings. 
Yes.
Yeah, we locked him up for two years.
No. Actually the trip sucked.
The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
It was not, it sucked.
Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige. That was great. That was great. That was--- that was a---
That was a really good choice.
No, David. You listen to me. Why did you send her away? That--- God. You knew I liked her and you just sent her away. And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.
That was a really sucky thing to do.
Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it's because they respect me. A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone. That's respect.
