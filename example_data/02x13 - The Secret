Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me.
What's up-dog?
Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!
Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?
Mmm, what flavour coffee is that? Up-dog?
I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?
 No, damn it!
What does what mean?
Just forget it.
Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
Gotcha!  Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?
 Damn it.
Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring? Anything. They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind. Well I say that an empty desk means a...
No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.
Yes.
On a Friday? 
I will do all the talking.
What difference does it make whether your here?
Hi, Oscar its Michael.
Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.
What are your symptoms?
Umm, hmmm.
I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday. Unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend.
He sounded sick.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time. It's much sexier.  Man, this must be torture for you.
Hey Jim-bag.
Really?
Who else knows?
Wow!
Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship. And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.
My lips are sealed.  My lips are sealed... Bangles.
 Can you hear me, they talk about us...
Hey, whatcha gettin'?
Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
Any of em? So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the "P" situation?
P-A-M. P-A
No it's okay, we're talking code.
Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?
Alright, well, cool.  Still deciding?
 Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.
It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.
Not so much.
Nothing.
Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.
Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
Ok.
Good.
Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch?
Oh nonsense , no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.
Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.
I know just he place.
 Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?
Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi.
We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.
I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
Mmmm, sounds yummy. I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. 
No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog.
What do you like best about Pam?
Is it her boobs, or...
Really?
Never get's any of my jokes.
Her boobs, definitely.
Oh, thank you.
Ohhh happy birthday Jim!
Woo! Yeah!
Thank you very much.
Hilarious. Hey.
Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
Just do it.
 Expenses.
No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
Yeah, it's a business lunch.
No he did not. I don't need his permission.
Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?
I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related?
You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please?
You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.
I know, I know, I know.
I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that  this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.
Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.
Yeah I'm good.
Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim.
No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.
People are always coming to me. "Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust." No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.
