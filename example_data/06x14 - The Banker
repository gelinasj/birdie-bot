Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... I'm... pretty nervous about it. And... I'm... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way: when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.
 I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?
What is the world's largest ocean?
Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?
That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant.
Hello, Stanley.
Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit -
- since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?
They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it.
No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it.
 Oh, my God.
Alright. Excuse me.  If you will -
- follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two. 
I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about?
Stuff. I love stuff.
HR stuff?  What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
Ah.
Talkin' bout, uh, what?
Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
Oh, time and resources.
No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever. 
This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive.  Right? Would you agree with that?
That's, that is true. 
I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin? 
I don't care if he goes and files a report and says that we're nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
Computron, I'm gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?
Just - sh -
Shut -
Shut up. Shut up.
 Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'.
So check out how we live
They call it Scranton!
The Electric City. Scranton!
The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider.
Plenty of space in the parking lot.
Snack attack time.
We like Cugino's
They call it Scranton!
