Buenos dias, Erin.
No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
Buenos dias, Jaime.
Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
La telefona.
 Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
Damn it.  Ah, Angelo.
Yo soy Cancun.
Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
Did somebody order a hooker over here?
Hi. How are you?
There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...
Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.
 Hi.
Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
Okay, I have more of them.
I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go!  Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
And that would be a display  of the crisp, gorgeous black.
It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.
This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.
Ryan.
And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
Oh, thanks.  You're not bad, either.
Hmm.
Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
 You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?
Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
I think we could. 
Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
Why don't you run them again?
If she is, it's working.
So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...
Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish.  Just kidding. Do you like mints?
I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
They're good 
Sure.
I can't stop myself from kissing her.
Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.
Okay. What do you think?
Andy?
Okay, some for, some against.
Pam?
I'm going with Pam's group.
Here we go.
Okay.
No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.
We should have your contract done by Thursday.
Okay.
Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
I don't know. I think so.
 Okay. So... Oh, Donna?
Thank you so much.
Mmm. 
 Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...
All right. All right. Bye.
And have a good elevator ride.
Oh, what's that out there?
I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
She suckered you too.
Was it the cleavage?
Yep.
God. She left this here?
Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
 Well...
Yeah, I know. I know.
I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. 

Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.
Who?
About what?
No, no. No.
No... 
 What happened?
Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it!  I kissed. We kissed.
No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette  We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts.  I did do it!
