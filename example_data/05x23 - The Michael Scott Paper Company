It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company. 
Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! 
I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey.  Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
We are in the heart of it.  And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. 
Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
Hey Ryan?  Could you get to that copy from before?
Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
Would someone just make the copy?
Just make that copy okay?
They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right? 1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
No, you're supposed to say, "Rock the house."
That's my corner.
No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
Pam, I don't make the rules. 
Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
Thank you. You remember Ryan  And Pam is around here somewhere.
What for?
Yes.
Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em.
Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary.  Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
Hey Pam.
You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Yeah?
Well, at least you're still being honest with me.
These are shaped like paper.
I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting.  Pick up the phone.
Don't tell them we have free delivery! 
They don't know that!
Give him a guarantee.
Just say the word.
Yes!
You did!
Oh yeah!
She did it!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really  Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.
