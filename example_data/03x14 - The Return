Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.
Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...
I said 'was'.
What does that even mean? That is impossible.
But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
Hey, what's up.
Yep.
I don't know. Maybe.
Bathroom.
Wow.  What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
Yeah, do you?
What did I say?
Huh.
Oh, no.
No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.
No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.
Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?
Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?
Really?
Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
Nice to have Oscar back.
Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
Um.
No. I don't want to do any of that.
No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.
Hey.
What's up?
Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
How's this place treating you?
Oh, well.
No. I'm sure.
So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
We can talk about that.  All right.
Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it.  Not bad, huh?
Guilty.
Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? 
It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.
