Hey, sport.
Ow! God!
No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.
Yeah, so there you go.
Oh, wow, so quickly.
Nope. Nope. Not yet.
I'll call her later.
I don't want to do that.  She is going to freak out!
That's -- thanks.
Mom, I'm getting married.
Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.
No. 
I'm not, I'm not getting married. So...  Psych.
And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
I'll take care of that for you.  Thanks.
Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. "Schindler's List" parody. ... That's not appropriate, no.
Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did.
No.
Wow.
Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
No, no, no, no, no.
Do I look like I am joking?
If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
You're not.
Jimbo, let's do this thang.
Oh, come on.
You too?
Jim, they are a poopy. 
No.  Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --
I agree.
So let's see what we can find out from reading.  Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
 Arrogance.
And there's our smudgeness.
Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?
Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.
 Ask him his name.
Be respectful, Dwight.
It's up to you to change his mind.
Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!
He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
Stop it! Stop it!
That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
Here we go.
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.
Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?
 See what I did?
Yes.
...  It's a million-dollar sale.
Why don't you tell us?
Dwight.  I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
What's going on?
 Kelly.
You cannot say "I was raped" and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.
Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
You were lying.
Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.
I will call you when it is time. 
I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?
I think you should do that.
