Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
Huh?
Pop quiz.
Why is today a special day?
Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
In business school, Kevin. Business school.
A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
Will they throw their hats, you think?
A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: "May your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... That was a pretty good line.
I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz!  Whoa, hey!
We have fun.
Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class?  Whoo!
Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting.  I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or...  Satisfied?
Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
...And products!
Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. 
...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.
...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.
Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?
Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
...Wait, Ryan said that?
Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
David will always beat Goliath.
Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, s*x predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?
Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you.  SO SUCK ON THAT!
Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
You heard me, pack your things.
Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.
Wow! You did these... freehand?
My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it.  ... How much?
I don't see a... price.
Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?
That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
What?
...Chunky. Do you want half?
Okay.
It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
