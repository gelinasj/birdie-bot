Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, "Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening." Makes you feel good.
I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
Top 80 percent!
Yeah?
Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
Oh, come on. Come on.
You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...
Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
What?
That's a dog.
That's a shawl.
No. Humans with AIDS.
Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. "I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head."  And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.
I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
Well, actually, it's my warehouse.
Why are you here?
Not. I said, not that.
That's ironic.
That you are afraid.
Dinkin' flicka.
Give me some. 
 Yes
Who?
Do I know a Carol Stills?
Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it real good?
Hi, Carol. How you doing?
Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you... What do you...
Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
Okay, put her through.  Jan Levinson, I presume?
Hey, Jan. How you doing?
I am?
Oh, okay.
AIDS.
Okay, sounds great.
Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
Right.
Yeah?
What?
Okay.
Problem. Good.
Good, All right. Sounds great.
Bye.
Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
Hey, hey.
Hey, Carol.
You look great.
Oh, well... Kiss. 
Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
Okay.
Billy, your nurse is hot.
Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
Chili's is great.
Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled! Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
All-in. 
Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
What are... That's insane.
Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.
Okay, all right, whatever.
You really screwed that up. 
Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Jan.
Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.
Um...
Hey. What...
All right!
Four!  All right, here we go!
Yeah!
So close. So close.
Hey, okay.
Thank you.
Okay. Thanks for coming.
Okay. Talk to you Monday.
Good night. She's a good boss.
Oh, she's great.
Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.
