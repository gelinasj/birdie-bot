I'm going to give Erin $15.
A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
She's kind of a rube.
Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
 Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.
I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to... lunch.
Ugh.
Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...
Okay, well, we'll figure something. 
 Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.
All right.
 Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
 I don't know.
Ahhh.
Right. 
An age or month?
I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
So how are things going with Andy?
Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.
Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.
I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter.
Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.
Okay.
I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having s*x with somebody else.
They were engaged, so...  Okay, you know what, sir?
Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?
Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Well...
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.
 I'll have what she's having!
 Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..
No. No. No.
Stop talking.
Oh God.
Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
Erin?
No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
You said butt.
Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: "Hey! Hey Scott!"
 Good work Cookie Monster.
