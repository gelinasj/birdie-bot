Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car...
Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!
Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go!
Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.
I will allow that.
Okay.
Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
Yes, Phyl?
 Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.
 That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay.
 Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times.
Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one.
Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?
Okay, the opposite of that?
Ooh, someone's freakin'.
I think he is.
Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?
4:35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have s*x like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we?
We can do...
Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
What is October feast?
Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.
That's right, let's do this.
Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out.
Are you kidding?
You can do this. You can do this.
I'm scared, too.
Yeah.
We're going to have a baby.
Let's do that.
Two minutes apart.
It's okay.
I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon.
We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is?
You're not going to. You know where you're going?
Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have?
Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please!
No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it.
Yes.
Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag?
You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
Thank you! Wish me luck!
 Here we go! Here we go! On our way!
Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now!
No, no, no, no! Out, out! Idiot.
Dwight, what is the traffic like?
Alright.
Geesh, Dwight!
What!?
Where?
By the bushes?
Okay, go, go, go, go!
Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised.
Yeah?
I'm texting about you, okay!?
Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go.  Ready?
Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday.
Okay.
Okay.
Do you have everything, guys?
Okay, alright. 
Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay.  I just did.
Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go.
 Okay, not yet, not yet. I'm going to go wash my eyes.
That kid's going to have a lot of hair.
I think it's going to be any minute now.
Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright.
 Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...
You're starting, you're kinda losing them.
 Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see?
Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days.
Guys, guys!
Eleven pounds...
Thank you! Thank you!
Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma.
Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you.
Love you, as a friend.
Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
Alright.
Oh, okay.
Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael.
There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family.
Who else here is single?
I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too.
Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  Who else? Come on! People, I know models!
Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single.
Andrew, what about you?
Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together?
Good!
Sure. Kevin, please leave.
Bye.
Okay. This is going to kill Kevin.
I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah.
No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him... I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him.
Kevin. Erin would like a few words with you.
Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.
No.
Lynn was as hot as Erin.
This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy?
Kev... Nice. Going.
 There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick...
