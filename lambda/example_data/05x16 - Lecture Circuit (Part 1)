 Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.
Could I stick it with a pin?
 because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.
You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.
What?
You find it?
All right.
Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
 Hello, good morning.
You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles.
Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam.  Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.
No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go!  Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
Well that goes without saying.
Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant? That's...
...kind of  Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
No. Oh, all right.
No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.
You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
Is that why your wearing makeup today?
Hello, Rolando, how are you?
Rolando,  I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked.
That's what I do, steal my trick.
 Oh my God. Is that Jim's?
Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had s*x, and...
Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?
 Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?
I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars? 
I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.
I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. "M" your name is Mark.
Got it. It works.
But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
Oh, I still have more.
She is pregnant. She is knocked up. "K" Karen. Pam, let's go.
I grab this , and I turn it on and I say, "Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre."
No, don't worry, the chain is off.
Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it.
It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
Oh, great.
No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time.
Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.
I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.
Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
Why?
No. I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.
 I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
 Okay.
