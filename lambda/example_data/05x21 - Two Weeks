I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit. I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go. Feeling good. Listen to some tunes. Should've peed before I left.
Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door.
No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
I looked at Wallace and I said "I quit!" and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said "You have no idea how high I can fly."
Why would I do that?
You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch.  Clinky, clinky-clink. Come-on... come on, come on.
 What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that. I gonna stay up all day. Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO! And I'm going to stop worrying about calories.
I have a job.
Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted.
Any good headhunter knows I am available.
You're 'I need you to' is my command.

You... oh. Somebody has been talking in bed. Pillow talk.
This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients. Half of them, at least. I can do it again. I know the market, I know the price points. I'm on it, don't worry. So, how do I do that?
Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
Thank you very much.
