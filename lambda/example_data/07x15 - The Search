Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
You broke up with AJ weeks ago.
I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
Sure we do.
Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree.
Yes I do.
Yes I do.
I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
Let's go.
Let's go!
Just drive faster. I want to get back.
Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.
No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is s*x different after the baby, Jim?
I need to pee.
Yeah, I do. My word against yours.
What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
Well I hope I make it.
I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted.
There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He's my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!
Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick.  And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?
You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number.
Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good.  Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok.
 I'm being serious. Seriously.
Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.
Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
With that I can buy... half the menu.
All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?
Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?
Okay. You've just lost my business.
Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?
Okay. I'll be right back. . Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.
Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
Well the number three is not such a giant feast.
I am not. I just have had a bad day. And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.
Well, I think I can get through the door.
Hi.  How did you know I was up here?
I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
Yeah.  Wow. I just miss you so much.
Really?
Can I kiss you?
Okay.
