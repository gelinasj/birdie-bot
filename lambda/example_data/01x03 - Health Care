Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
Lay them on me. What?
That's not what you said earlier.
The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.
I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.
You gotta crack these things open.
Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.
Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.
There, there...
 When have you ever done that?
Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
Yeah!
Really?
Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
Nope, you cannot use it.
Temporary workspace. You can use it.
If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.
 Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?
Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?
Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.
I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
Ah, what? Which memo?
Is it a good plan?
Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him.
You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings.  Couldn't find the knob.
So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...
 Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.
So it's not a free fall?
Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?
Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!  Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.
Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
There you go.
Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.
 Oh, Christ.
Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?  Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.
 God, yeah... Ah! This...
Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting.  "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork." Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.
