Hup! 
Hup! 
Hey.
 Is this good?
Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?
I really appreciate it.
It's for your trouble.
No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
Yes, I do.
That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
Bring it in. Morning cheer. 
 I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
I'm not following you.
Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.
Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
Can I use it? 
 Dwight, are you talking about us?
Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
Dwight?
Is the cool new guy Charles?
Is it Stanley?
Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?
Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
Dwight, run!
You be cool.
Just-what's going on?
Mm-do... Dwight would not-
I. Understand. Nothing.
 Wow.
It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?
Hello, traitor.
I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
I'm just getting hardcore with him.
Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.  Bill Cosby.
 Is Mr. Schofield there?
 Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
Wow. High score?
Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?
So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
Toward the sun.
Noon.
You have two seconds. 
Dwight.
I hope you're not recording this conversation.  Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
I do too.
Cooper's.
Damn it.
 Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
What?
Yeah, sure.
Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.
 Yeah.
Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic.  You?
What about our truce?
On purpose?
Why?
Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
Oh.  b*st*rd!
Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
Walking in the door...
Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. 
 Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
That's very rude.
I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
Good, good, good. I will see you.
I color code all my info. I wrote "gay son" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means "Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?" Most colors mean "Don't say it."
I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
