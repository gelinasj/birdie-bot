It is six a.m.  and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. 
Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.

Surprise!
You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
 Here we go! Have Pam come down.
 Congratulations!
We got it.
Yeah that's fine.

 Go go go go go go!
 I've never seen this place in the daylight.
Here we go, alright got it? Set? 
Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
 Go.
 Good morning Erin.
You have big plans for tonight?
You are getting so funny!  Very good.
The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
Anything can happen at the Dundies!  They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
Black tie optional.
A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. 
Think of it as part of your training.
 Okay, well we'll work on it.
You are doing it.
 Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
 Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...
Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay.  Ryan how are you today?
 There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration. Just be funny.
No! God! 
No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
Jim, please no loopholes.
This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
Good. Good. Good!
Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
 and make it sound perfect.
Say it with an accent!
 The Dundies!
I'm here.  In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
 DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!
No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!
Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!
 You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It's showtime. Get out there.
Say it.
You can do it, just say it.
Now hit me.  One, two, three.
Alright, here we go.
Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. 
There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! 
Well done.
Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie.  I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to,  Danny couldn't be here tonight...
Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that.  Come on up here you sick b*st*rd.
You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? 
 There you go.
It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. 
 DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
Okay, we're done! That's it.
We're done. We're done!
 So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...
What?
No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
So what you're saying is you kinda like it?  That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
That got a big laugh.
 You were laughing right?
We're really close.
That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.
 You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
What is your problem?!
Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
He is in an all-out sprint.

Oh, okay. 
Oh my God, something's happening.
.
No it's not.
Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it!
