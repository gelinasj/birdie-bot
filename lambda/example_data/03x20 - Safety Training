Today is Safety Training Day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
Hmm.
I can, and I have.
Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.  Pudge has driven the forklift.
I thought your name was Pudge?
Okay. Um, her.
Ah, fine.
Yeeesh.

Bail'er? I hardly know her.
Yes, yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
It's a big red trash compactor!
Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions...
...would I go near---
Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go!
Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and...
Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour?
Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  Um, let's see. "Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter."
Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.
Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---"
Yes. "Which can contribute to heart disease." Heart disease kills more people that balers.
Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...
No.
Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours. So, I---
Okay. ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?
Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse. I worked in a warehouse. Men's Warehouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. Probably make 'em feel like wimps. Not me, I... "Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Warehouse. We have a special on khaki pants today." ... This is one example.
Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff.
I--- I--- Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
Yeah... you are... ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
Indubitably.
They use props. They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression---
Nn--- Depression.
Yes.
You may be asking yourself, "What am I doing on a trampoline?" Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day. Not! Here's the plan. Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh my God! He is on the roof! Now I have got their attention. I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, "Hey! You ever seen a suicide?" And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side note
Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or...
Go buy some watermelons.
Just...
Let's do it! Drop that sucker.
BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess.
Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
Yes, thank you for seeing that.
I don't know if I wanna do this.
No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking.
Rock n' roll!
That's right! I am not thinking.
Yes! Yeah!
Woo!
Woo!
I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point! 
 My life! Oh, my life...
Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study!
Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil!
Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
Okay... that's...
That's the whole point, dummy.
Okay.
Oooooh, my life!
Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
Dwight, you ignorant slut.
And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
Damn it.
What is it?
Dwight, find out what the present is.
Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it?
You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
What do I have to live for?
It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The s*x isn't nearly as good as it used to be.
Do you really mean that?
I'm braver than you?
I Braveheart. I am.
Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
An office... is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That's the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can't say. But, yes.
