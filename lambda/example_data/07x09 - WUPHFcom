 My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
Uh... try "password".
Uh... it was like eight years ago?
Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been... Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.
You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.
The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
Morning.
 I'm Facebook.
I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back.
A what?
Dot com!
I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop.
Your kidding?!
You and me.
Don't you work here full-time?
Mm-Hmm.
That does sound fun to me.
Excuse me, everyone... s*x! Now that I have your attention...
MONEY!
Pervert.
That's good to know. 
Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.
Whoo!
We already have a buyer.
At least.
That's right!
Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
There you go.
Do not talk like that, Stanley.
Here we go.
"It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!"
"He's up there."
Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground!
No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.
I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?
I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell.
Can't talk, saving the planet.
We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
 Eight Years.
No, I won't even consider it.
Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.
I think you are wrong.
You may be right. I may be crazy.
I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.
I thought it might make me feel better.
 No.
Good, good, bro.
Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
Nine days, though. That's, like...
Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.
Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
So you would think that's a good idea for me to do?
Mm-Hmm.
Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so...
Tonight?
Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
Hello.
I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend.  And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.
Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money.
You can't have it.
The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt.  That's Uh...
Thank God.
