Hey.
That was really fun last night.
I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
Yeah?
Oh really?
Well...
I, uh...  I let her win.
So, when, um, can I see you again?
No.
Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good.  Because I am busy taking you out.
 Why?
Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight...
Tonight's so...
Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
You're welcome.
In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have s*x. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having s*x with me I'll know for sure.
Yeah.
Some of what we order depends on whether we're having s*x after.  Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have s*x tonight?
Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.
Probably get soup or something light.
No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes.  I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.
Do you need 'em?
All right.
Thank vous. 
Not if we turn these dials  Now they can't hear us at all.
We're totally alone.
Oh, my God, what happened?
Yeah. Oh... oh!
No, did you?
Oh, no, my God.
Oh my God!
So much for s*x without consequences.
We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?
To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
Thank you.
Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.
I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-
Do I?
Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.
Whoa!
Twice. ... Right?
Mm-hmm.
Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed.  What the hell is that?
It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!
Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-
Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says "Creed."
Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man.
Federal and State. 
Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
We are getting there folks. Slow and steady.  Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!

All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item.  All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around?
No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody.
Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so.
She's your wife, you idiot.
