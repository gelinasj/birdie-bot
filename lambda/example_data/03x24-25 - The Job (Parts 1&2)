 David!
Are we all set?
Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
Thought I'd catch a show.
Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
Um, how many people are you interviewing?
Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
Ah, great. No further questions.
Okay.
And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons.  Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.
 Yeah.
Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
Okay. Uh...
Uh, okay.
Stop crying.
Ohhhhh...
Why so you can do it?
No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
Moon each other.
All right.
Your loss.
Cruise control.
There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
Yes, I...
I have to buy another place.
I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time.
Who is D. Abramson?
Why... are you here?
I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
Why privately?
Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
Okay.
Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
No. She's an alternate.
So, how you been?
Good.
Yeah.
Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.
Hmm.
Sound good. Sounds fun.
Hmm..
Would you excuse me for a second?
Defcon twenty. She wants to get back together.
I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...
No, no. What do I do?
What if she makes me?
She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
I wasn't.
You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
Wow.
I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.

Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
Yeah.
First got priorities.
Let's get back together. 
No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is... emotionally magnificent.
 Remarkable.
Wait, wait. Check one more time.
Very good 
Yes, indeed.
So, I guess we're getting back together.
Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly. We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery.
Hey, everybody. The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
 How are you guys doing? Need anything?
I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.
That is Beardy.
Mm-hmm.
No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so...
I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep.
Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
Jan in yet?
Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
Just say, "I want to squeeze them." It's code. She'll know what it means.
Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her,  "Brbrbrbrbr!" also?
 Hello, hello!
Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
Thank you.
I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper. It's super duper." I don't know, something like that.
Okay.
Thank you.
It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh! Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together. So... I may need to fill out one of those love documents again.
Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her.  Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.
I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?
Hey.
Pretty good.
Could have gone better I guess.
Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun.
I can't tell you.
Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
Hey! You're unstable!
No--- We're all unstable.
David, I did not tell her.
So, I am gonna... give her a ride home. Let me know about the job.
Good, I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal?
Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though.
Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two.  Either one of them... excellent candidates.
I know. I know, I'm sorry about that. That was terrible.
Well, it's...  No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.
 Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
 I'll be baaaaack! And I am baaaack!
No. No, Pam. I'm baaaaaack! For gooood! Kevin Nealon.
Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. "Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in." Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black?
That's stupid.
You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  Ryan, coffee.
No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids.
So I'm back. And I am never, ever going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
 Still waitin' on that coffee.
