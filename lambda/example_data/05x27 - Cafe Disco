 Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
Oh, really? Ok.
What about the rest of you? 
At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
Who else? Who else? Ryan?
Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
What?
Ugh! God! What happened to you people?  We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
 I... was just learning... to... love.
No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
That's good.
If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...
Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
Now you got it.
Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
Ok. I love it. I love it.
I love it.
Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like  Dave died or something.
Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Andy's afwaid?
Are you all afwaid?
Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
Funk is the problem and the solution.
I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.
... with coffee but without the haunted.
It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
Exactly.
Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
Holdin' down the fort.
Thank you.
This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Kevin, stay.
Kevin, stay.
Stay, stay.
Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
Mmm-hmm.
Come on.
Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster.
Phyllis?
Hey!
 Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
Oh, wow! What did you do?
You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
No. No. No.
It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
 Alright. Here we go.
You having fun?
What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
Oh, you know. Nohting. She's - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So...
Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything. 
You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
It's better than I imagined it!
Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
Oh. Alright. There you go.
No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you."  No.
Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.
Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
No... cleaning... up.
Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.
You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
Really?
Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco!  Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to "Y".
Would you like to dance?
