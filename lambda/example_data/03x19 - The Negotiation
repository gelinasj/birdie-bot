No need for consternation, everything is under control.
It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
No...
No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.
Yeppers.
I don't... remember.
Yeesh...
Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
Wikipedia.
Wikipedia... is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.
Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think... 
What I'm saying is that, 
Ok, see what I did?
By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
Ok, let's try another one. Um...
Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
It's a surprise.
Go ahead, ask me for a raise.

What?
No, what did you say?
Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
 Yeah.
Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat.
You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room.
No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.
Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off.
Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
 I am declining to speak first.
Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.
What?
No, this is a power suit.
 I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again.
Ohh... kay.
All right.
Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin.
There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual.
Uh,  MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.
Okay.
Would you stop it, please?
It's European, OK? It's a European cut.
No, they don't. See? 
Italians don't wear pockets.
No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.
Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes.
Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.

 That was a very good point.
 You make a very compelling argument.
I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films.  No, slide--- slide it, yes.
Oh.  Come on. Be serious.
I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.
I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub.
Plus perks, yes.
Fourteen years.
No, please, please...
Ok, let's take 15, again.
A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.
Oh, thank you.
I didn't give you $40.
Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia.
I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
Well what am I supposed to do?
I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous.
 That's true.
You know what? I should.
I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
You know what? I deserve a bump.
I am makin' it happen, sergeant.
No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today.
Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away.
Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.
Mm-hm.
Hey, I'd rather kill myself.
 No, Toby is terrible. Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.
 Fine.
Toby, come on. Let's go.
Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go.
Yeah. Fine.
 Don't ever touch a black man's radio! ...Chris Tucker. Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way.
Well...
Mm, the Big Apple.
Maybe I'll stay.
Well...
 Oh, I...
Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
All right.
Who's the boy toy?
Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
Pippity poppity.
Six percent? After all we've been through?
I got you... jade earrings.
No!
No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more s*x.  What are you writing, perv-ball?
Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart. This is me, Jan. This is me!
Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere.
Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---
Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
Ah, so... All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise.
But you just said 15.
Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more... than just salaries. It's about perks. Like having s*x with Jan--
