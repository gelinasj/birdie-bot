Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now.
I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God!
Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!
No, I want you to pick me up.
I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
I want to come to work. But I need you to come and pick me up. 
OH GOD!
Oh God!
OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.
Pam, could you come get me?!
Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?
There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that?
I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
 No one wants to pick me up!?
I'm not sick! I'm burned!
Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight.
I don't want Dwight!
I don't have a girlfriend.
It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight.
Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!
Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.
Did you explain why?
Burned my foot, Pam.
Please stop popping my cast. Thank you.
Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping...
Thank you. Pam, messages please?
Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...
No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God!
What?
I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask.
No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
What? Part of your duties are to what?
You just said "part of your duties are to" something.
Yes, you did. What is wrong with you?
Where is my cornbread?
Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like?
Where are the yams?
Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
And they had no yams?
How strange. Because they always have yams.
Pam... PAAAM!?
Come here please.
I want you to rub butter on my foot.
Pam, please? I have Country Crock.
Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!
No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you?
 No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!
I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.
Ugh, not you. Someone else. Get Pam.
Get Ryan. He needs to lift me.  and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel.
No, he's not.
I just saw him.
Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God!
Can I have everyone's attention please? Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question? Do you all know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar?
No, never heard of it. No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble.
Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
Ok,  what does this look like to you Stanley?!
Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
 I burned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!
While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
Good question. Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia : AIDS.
I don't think so, no.
He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works.  A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
What you mean uh hmmm... ?
Ok.
Yes, right in here, come on in.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
You are so brave. You are so brave.
But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.
Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.
How did you get in your wheelchair?
Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.
Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.
Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?
Ok...
Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I. When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...
Yeah...
Ok.
Did you see Born on the Fourth of July? I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.
 Hey!
You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan.
Did you get the yams?
 Ok, I'll just have the pudding.
Yeh.
You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
Why don't you go with him?
I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.
Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive.
We'll go. I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
Shotgun!
The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout "shotgun" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game's played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
Oh, God, a mini-van. What is Meredith's problem?
Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.
Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.
I know, just sayin'.
Dwight, what are you drinking?
Give it to me.
Dwight...  Give me the bottle or you're fired.
Give it to me Dwight.
Give me the bottle!!
Gimme the bottle, Dwight!
Just give it!
Stop, stop it! Stop spraying!  Gimme the bottle!
Stop spraying me! Gimme the bottle!
Dwight, what is your middle name.
 Something with a "K".
What do I write under "reason for visit"?
Nothing. I wrote "bringing someone to the hospital".
No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. 
Hi Dwight.
Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
Ok, what kinda machine is that?
That's my joke, damnit Dwight.
It's ok, they're with me.
Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.
Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. We'll, see you when you get out.
Fine. Fine.
