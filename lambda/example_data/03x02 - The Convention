Pam?
Did you see Oprah yesterday?
I, uh... I am going to be a father.
Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.
I know.
Well...
Just do it, okay?
Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
Eight months?
I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.
You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby...
Twenty years.
Thirty.
It's a deal.
Yesh.
Right there. Ah.
Per diem.
Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled s*x romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.
Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?
Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.
Yeah, do it!
Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?
Um. Okay, um.
You got that?
Write it down.
Um.
Hey, Josh, how ya doing?
Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.
I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.
Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!
Hey!
Ah.
Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.
The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.
Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
That is crooked on that side.
Hey hey!
Yeah.
Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.
Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?
Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.
All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.
Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.
SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.
Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.
You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.
Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?
So maybe. See ya.
Because he's afraid to fly.
Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!
Yep. Yeah, she's up front.
I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
 May I have a moment of your time please?
I need you to do something for me.
I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
And?
Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.
I will call him later with that message.
Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.
Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.
You're welcome.
No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
Any messages for 308? All right.
Hey hey, fellers.
What's up?
Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.
Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
Okay! Excellent. Oh...
Shut it.  Say hi to Pam!
Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim.  Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.
You first.
Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.
Well, let's...
Come on!
Come on!
Fine.
Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.
Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
Sorry, my meeting ran late.
Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.
Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.
This is the party.
Party central! So, what can I do you for?  All right.
People have been filtering in and out.
What?
Sure. You like Cosmos?
Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...
I'm not better than Josh.
Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.
Yeah.
I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.
Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
Evan, this is Jim.
Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?
Best friends.
Some people need dozens of friends to say, "Hey, look at me, I'm popular." But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.
Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir?  Ha, ha, ha.
Whoa. What are those stains?
Oh, God, I hope it's urine.
