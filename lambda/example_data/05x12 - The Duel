 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!
No. No, no. There was wind.
Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
I want another try. Here we go!  Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.
Beat it!
Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by  He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
Wait, you still don't know...
You still don't know.
 What are you doing?
Andy.
 No, what I'm saying is...
No, that's not it.
 How can he still not know?
I can't take it anymore.
I am telling Andy.
Who should it come from, then?

Did you ever have intercourse in this office? 
Well?
You know this can't go on.
We have to put an end to this.
Come on. 
When will she be ready?
Is she crazy in bed?
How so, specifically?
Really?
It's too late.
I am already walking.
Okay, what does that mean?
 Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
Thanks.  Andy?
Walk with me.
Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear...
Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.
Which will be fine. I am off!
Thank you! 
 Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
 Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
All right. See you later.  Ahh.
Yep. 
Right what?
David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.
Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.
This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.
 Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, "Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?" And he looks at me and he says, "Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket." And I look back at him and I say, "I feel the need!... The need for tweed."
 Oh, thank you.
I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
Okay. 
Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen.  Ahh!
