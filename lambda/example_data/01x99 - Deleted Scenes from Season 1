 Hello. I'm Michael Scott. I'm the best boss in the world.
Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?
Yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on Pam.
Messages?
Ah, right here. Three Stooges. High five.  Now, who was the one before Curly?
Curly? Very good. Curly Joe DeRita.
Well, comedy's kinda my thing. Watch this, here's Curly Joe. Mmm. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Oh, I forgot. Here we go. 
All these people are walking around and they're happy and their lives are just going along, ignorance is bliss. But if they knew what was lurking on the other side of that fence that furry monster.  "I'm gonna get you, downsizing." No. They wouldn't... They'd freak. And I'm not going to play God. They look to me for support. And they look to me for guidance and leadership. And I think if I could lie to them and it serves them, then that's what I'm going to do.
So this is our sales staff. They are the ones who are making calls and making us lots of money.  "Very interesting, but stupid." Artie Johnson. It's a crazy place.
What you don't know... Well, it can hurt you, but if you don't know it won't hurt you. Then, you can just be happy for a little while at least.
What's that?
Oh, John Belushi. What a crazy guy. Phew, freaked myself out this morning.
Yeah. I thought I found a lump. I checked the, uh... I check the jewels every month. This time... You know, it's a little different. It was fine. It was fine. But freaky, man, you know. Testicular cancer, God. Cancer, whoa testicles. So... What's, um... What you eating?
Oh, place around the corner. Nice. All right. See you later.
Do I need to speak up?  Hello.
I think better to be a happy idiot then a, um... Then someone who knows the truth.
Yeah. I would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.
No, the country.
Yeah, more like a 1,000.
I just think that HERO? It's cute, but it's... It's empty, you know? It's easy. Dwight, you know what, I came up with some terms of my own. Could you put these on the board? The first one is Inclusion, New Attitudes, Color-blind...
Expectations....
Thank you. Sharing...
And tolerance.
Well, it's not ideal but you have to give me some credit 'cause I made it into a word.
I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally...
No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.
Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry this guy's a temp and I should've told you that.
Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he's not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?
Well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot. You know what. Yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots. Cool? 'Cause the handicaps get a raw deal. Oh, you know what. That ties right into New Attitudes. New attitudes about handicap people. Very important.
"In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck."  No doubt about it.
Are we going?  Don't do that. Just say action when we're ready.
 Should I... turn, no. Do it again.
Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North." And those are the principles... Damn it. Okay, sorry. Don't laugh; please don't laugh this time Dwight. You're... it's, it's bugging me. Let me give myself a countdown, ready? Three, two, one.
Just let me do it! God! Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton... Keep the camera steady please! People are gonna get sea sick watching this. Ready? Three, two, one.
Don't. Please don't say anything.  Oh, God.
Could I count myself down please, Dwight. Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North." And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
 I want you to push it. I want you to push 'cause breakthroughs are right around the corner. Something's going to pop here. Something's going to pop between a party. Feel what it's like to be in someone else's skin. What does it feel like to be a different race? It feels pretty bad doesn't it. So let that come out.
Yeah, I marched on Washington back in the day. I went to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, U.S. Mint, congressman talked to our class. It was pretty cool.
Talk like you're talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going. 
Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?
Okay, all right. Let's keep on track. Keep on point. Let's do it.
Try my googi, googi.  Oh, man. This is what I thrive on. You know? It's like Don Rickles on acid, man. Right?
What, huh?
It's good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let's keep it rolling. Let's round it up.
Sorry, too busy can't even come to the door.
Yeah, no... 
You know what. I, um, I'm out the door. I'm going to a meeting. Pam, I'm headed out to another meeting. So see you later. Uh, here we go.
Well, it is time to call in a little favor. A buddy of mine runs this tourist attraction, actually it's big. It's probably one of the most popular in the state. So...
 Dunder Mifflin, we supply your office paper.
No, no, no, no. No, actually to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, here's the deal. Um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could bring them down to go on your big ride.
Well, it says here that it's a 300ft drop.
So it's not a free fall?
Uh, okay. So um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do? Is it like, uh... Do you have laser tag down there or something?
That's it?
Uh, he's a small client. They don't really buy much.
I've really learned from the greats. The great improvisers, Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, uh, the Brady guy not so much. He's more the signing, Wayne Brady. Um, Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting.  And I will already be laughing at the punch line. He hasn't even gotten to it. He doesn't even know what it is it. So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on. Like I'll watch T.V. and I'll be watching a show and I will think, oh, I know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny. And then they do. Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, "Oh you're... God your butt is fat." And I knew it. I know it's like I knew they were going to say that. I knew they were gonna go there. Don't go there. Um, but other... You know it's like uh, you know Leno, um and Letterman, Carson, you know. Need I say more? No.
We're all going bowling!
All righty then, well I see you're going for the whole bored supermodel thing. "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. May I help you?"  Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.
No, no. I get it, I get it, I get it. A child is born, "Oh, oh-hum." A beautiful sunset, "No, I'll catch the next one." Right? Unicorn walks into the office, "Oh, do you have an appointment?"  Okay, look Pam this is not meant as a criticism, but let me tell you what you're doing wrong. You are the voice of this company, right? And when clients call and you're not smiling they can hear that in your voice. It is a real turnoff.
Yes, I am, absolutely. So, the next call we get I'd like you to smile. I'd like to see a big smile.
Okay. 
I know, somebody will. And we'll wait.
I know, I know, we will wait.
We will wait for the call and you will smile. Let me try something, just while we're waiting.
Tell me if I'm smiling or not.  Hi Pam, how are you? Was I smiling?
Okay, let me try this one.  Hi Pam, how are you?
I mean you can tell.
I wasn't smiling that time and they can tell too.
Thank you. All right, when we get a call I'll come back and you'll do the smile.
Show time! It's show time!
Okay.
Do a poem for Meredith's birthday or uh, limerick. Limerick. Um,  there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Come on in. Who had a big, smifflin.
No, not at all come on in.  No, no. You can't. No, red hair is my area. We have it on tape, so...
I was going to put that in my message, Toby. All right? So just cross it off. Cross it off, now.  What are you doing? Oh come on, you're ruining it. Toby, come on. Just, look at that. That's wrecked. Ass. Get some white out.
That's my white out. Get your own white out. Just... what's the matter with you? God.  Mifflin, spifflin.
Hey.
Uh, yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
Which one is that again?
Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny here, okay. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
 Come up with a joke that I can use, okay?
Help me out here.
No, not a uterus joke Dwight. Please. Something useable. A joke.
What?
There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight. You know what, I am on a deadline here and just, okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'm... I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight.  Thanks for coming in, that's always... Always helpful when I give him a call. Call him in.
Meredith. Oh, oh man, ah gosh. I can't remember why I came over here. Ha, ha.
I know. Ugh, that is so annoying.  Well, if you think of something, let me know. 'Cause I like to know. 'Cause I'm going crazy.
Oscar, uh for future reference just think you should know, that you should probably make it clear that your nephew is doing the walkathon and that he doesn't actually have cerebral palsy. Okay.
No, no. I know you didn't intend to, but I just I got the idea and I, uh, I just don't it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something. You know? And then prey on their emotions.
No, hey it's just kinda uncool, okay? I, just... Play fair, you know, play fair.
Thank you.
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
 You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, Okay, here's a good one. Um..."Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
Divorce. Um... Okay, "Meredith is so old..."
If everybody... could do it? "Meredith is so old..."
"She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her."
 What's the difference between Meredith and Michael Jackson? Michael Jackson's surgery was unnecessary.
Yes! Thank you. God. She gets it.  We just picked the best one right? Just had it.
Um, no, no. Come on. No. Don't comfort... don't comfort her, that's not... She doesn't need comforting. We're just joking around. I think she's... No that's very unprofessional. I think she's being very unprofessional over there.
 Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
Uh, yes. Thank you for noticing.
Uh, they look that good? Wow.  Oh, Pam please behave. Mike Myers, genius. Um, no actually I got them at a fancier place. Target.
Uh...
Yes, yes. Assistant to the regional manager.
No, it's not. It's lower.
What was that?
That look?
Like trying to find the camera, to give the camera a look. Okay, we're done. Is that your stomach? I keep hearing somebody's stomach.  God.
So, you uh, see the Sixers game last night?
 Oww whoo whoo! The Answer was on fire!
Oh, man! Man I tell ya. Iverson has maybe got me beat by like 20 pounds, 3 inches. 
No, neither am I. We both look good.
Do I have a nickname on the court, um? Well, The Answer would be nice, but it's taken. So, uh, probably The Question. The Answer dishes to The Question. The Question back to The Answer. Answer over to The Question. The Answer, whew,  six points. Nothing but net. Question, who's the best player in the league? Answer, The Question. Or the Drunkmeister.
Packer. Pac-man.
Pac-man 
I'm not your lover! I'm am not Michael Scott, I am Dr. Bergerstein. Your proctologist.
Ah, yes. Ah. 
It's not a Jewish joke, so don't worry.
 No, hey, hey , hey. You know what I just wanted to remind you about the game today. One 'o clock. Big game, big game.
Mmm. No, you said you could man. We're counting on ya. You know you're playing point guard.
No. Hey... I mean, although it's just for fun, you know we want... I was counting on you man.
 I... I think you can play. Like you could when you were a kid. I think you can never give up the play. Because if people stop playing, then they stop living. It's like a shark. If a shark stops playing he stops living. And sharks are very playful creatures.
You know what. I think most basketball movies are great movies. Because it's a great subject. There's one about a little kid who, um, joins a professional basketball team and he's really, really good and he can dunk and he's like 3 feet tall. And he can dunk the ball. That, oh, I love that movie. That movie kind of, that movie makes me cry. I don't like to cry on camera, but that movie makes me cry. Um, because it touches a cord in me about hoops.  Short, short, short! And basketball is like jazz, you know. To like pertipify it there's a jazz musician, a guy, you know... if you know jazz you know who I mean. He's uh, God what was his name? Um, he plays one of those curly horns, like those really shiny curly horns that's used in jazz a lot.
Birdie. He's not the guy with the cheeks. Kenny G. Is... if you knew jazz, you'd know who I mean. Kenny G. God. Glad I remembered that. Jazz people know who he is.
 Dwight, pass it to Jim! Pass it to Ryan!
Stanley, gotta play hurt.
I just want you know, you've been a big disappointment to me today, okay.
I'm in. I'm in. Here we go.  Zone, Phyllis! We're playing zone!
Yes! Yes! All right. We got game!
Dwight. Dwight. Dwight! Okay, that's it. Keep it in your pants.
Well, don't do that. Where are your glasses?
He wears glasses. Did you know that?
Well, now suddenly he can see.  There you go steaming hot cup of joe.
Oh, I know your hero. Yeah, saving you from Animal Planet Jack over there. 
Yeah, yeah he is the worst.
What's the um, saying, "once their laughing they're... that's... Once they're laughing that's 50 percent of them being horizontal. So, not that I'm just... Not that that's my... that's what I'm trying to do, but I think it helps kind of melts the ice. Breaks the ice, melts... Breaks the ice and melts them. Melts their hearts.
Thank you, Al Gore... for the Internet. Can send messages from one side the global to the other in the blink of an eye. Can you believe we couldn't do that ten years ago?
Right, but 20 years ago we couldn't and that is amazing. Here's Toby from Human Resources. This is Katy. Toby, Katy.
 Cup of Soup's a good idea though. That'll... that's a good budgetary thing to do.
Well, they're good snacks. They're good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin' in the car?
'Cause he slept in the car a couple times.
Are you still taking the antidepressants? 'Cause it was a good idea. 'Cause it'll help. It'll help, man.
Okay. I'll see you in a bit.  She's pretty cute isn't she? See you in a bit.
All right. That's looking good. Hey um, Ryan do you have any music I can borrow.
Ah, I know, everything really. I love it all. I love music.
Yes, I love both of those so much. A lot of 'em.
Mmm hmm. I like 'em.
Yes. God. They're awesome.
Uh huh. Yup. That last thing they did was great.
Cool, so maybe hook me up with some Fleebulls and some Hive.
All right. This is gonna be good.
