Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?
Oh, it's okay, I'm going down.
All right, I'll be right back. 
 There you go.
You're welcome.
Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute. 
There you go, fresh from the warehouse.
There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.

I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained.
 All right.
Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me?
Oh, wow.
Attention, everybody. I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first. My old boss Ed Truck has died.
Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss.
That's right, you worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by. Cheer me up.
So did you hear the news?
Yeah.
Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really? It's... pssssh... . He was almost 70. Circle of life.

Yeah. Mmmmmm.
Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'.
The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that.
What?
Oh my God.
That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
 So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...
What are you doing?
I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.
You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
 A statue.
Yeah.
Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.
We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...
I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
Life-size.
Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
Mm hm.
Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
But Ed truck can't because he is---
DEAD.
That's perfect.
Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam.
What?
Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head!
Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!
There are five stages to grief, which are  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.
I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.
Okay, fine. Hurry back.
 Okay, we can start. Um...
Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.
 Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go.
Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay.
Do you want to talk about it anymore?
Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's.  Do you think that this is a game?
All right, we're starting over.
You are not leaving. No! We are not done.
Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. 
How do you know?
That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?
Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING! 
 Oh, God!
Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ...
Oh shhhh--oot!
No, he's not.
No, he's not. 
Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!
We don't know if it's dead.
Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it.
No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now.  Find a box for him.
It's okay. It's okay.  Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.
What are... What are you doing?
No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?
Glad you could all make it.
Dwight, do you have the box?
You made this? Wow.  That's... that's very nice.
Yes.
Shhh.
Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.
