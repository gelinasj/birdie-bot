Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.
Ohh. May I?
 Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.
Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know.
I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... I'm just kidding.
Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.
Hannah?
Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
Because you think he's black.
Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.
In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
Good. All right. 
Just... try to be cool.
Okay, are you cool, really?
Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison.  No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
Hey Martin, how's it going?
Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.
...Danny Glover.  Yeah.
Who?
Oh. Please. Colin Powell.
Yup.
Apollo Creed.
Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.
No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.
 That is awesome.
Well, we are running a business, so.
Ah. Well. That's not true.
No you would not.
This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.
Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go!
Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?
It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.
Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?
Ah. A ten inch black and white?
These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.
All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say "Boo" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like . I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!
Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!  You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!
Internet.
And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.
And I nevah got caught, neither.
Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?
Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. 
No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.
They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
 Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.
