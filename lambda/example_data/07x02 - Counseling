This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.
I know what you want to ask me. "Did your mom ever see you naked?"
So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.
One hour.
One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.
No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.
You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.
Toby, can I really tell you anything?
Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my pen1s... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.
And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? 
Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that?  Three hours. We're half way done.
This is plenty complicated.
I've played it once or twice with Jeff.
Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.
Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.
Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.
I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly.
When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so...
Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
Ok.
You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these  and call me in the morning.
You forged them! You forged the forms!
Yes.
Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet...  Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!
