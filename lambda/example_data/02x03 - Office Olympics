I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.
Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.
Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone," "Risky Business." Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
Ok.  Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
Maybe.
Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
Sign the papers at the condo.
Uh, I don't need one.
I don't need a representative.
No, No.
No. Dwight. I'm fine.
Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.
Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.
As my associate.
No it is not.
Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.
We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.
Very good.
We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?
Good. The Small Business Man?
Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked. Thank you.
Ok. See you soon.
I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please...
I... Just... Would you put it up?  Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
I do not understand what you spend your money on.
Home, sweet home.
Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait...  no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.
Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.
Nice to meet you too.
Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.
This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness.  Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
I'm putting my bed right over here.
Well, then I will get a warrantee.
Well then I won't get a warrantee.
So that's the problem, is solved. What?
Uh... Ten year.
What? Wha? You said ten.
Ok, ok, ok.
Alright.
Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
Um. Oh.  Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?
Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
Oh, man.
Uh. 
The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't...
...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.
There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.
No, no, no.
I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
Ehhhh....
I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.
There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.
What the hell is a terrarium?
Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
We take separate cars.
Why would we do that?
No.
EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.
Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
Nobody likes beets.
Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
Stop it! 
Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?
Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
You know.
Really?
What's this?
I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.
Get up here, Dwight.
Yep, not as good as gold.  Why are you playing the national anthem?
Oh.  What the hell is that?
