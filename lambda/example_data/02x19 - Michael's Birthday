So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich.  Alright.
Alright, let me explain. Again.  ... I have to go make a call.
Oh ho ho! What?
Thank you! That's really nice.
Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a perfect ice-breaker if I ever meet Terry Hatcher.
What's up?
Ah, thank you sir.
 Yeah.
Ohh, god.
No no no, no, new suit, please.
Thank you very much. It is from Italy.  Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
Good luck. One of a kind.
Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
Let's get the party started. Not the way I taught you! 
 Yeah?
Oh, great, put her through.
Hey, you.
It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
Thanks. 
Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. 
 ...You can take a five, if you want.
Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
Thanks.
Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
You didn't know it was my birthday.
Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut .
Mmm.
Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great!  Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?
 Okay. I'm so nervous.
When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
 Stop it. Stop! What is that?
Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this .
What?
 Ohhh, God.
Ohhh, no.
Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
Okay.
Thank you.
Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
Get in here... everybody.
Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
The best.
Yes.
Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
Just the bread, it's fresh baked.
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want.  And choke on it.
When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So... That was the worst birthday I think I ever had.
Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... 
... I asked for trick candles.
Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again.  Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.
... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us .
There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
And laughter... also.
Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
 Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
How dare you sir. You are gross.
 That should not be there.
No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!
Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
Kevin. You heard anything yet?
Okay. Well. Live strong.
Alright.
Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
Oh, these... all your kids?
Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
Push. Good! That's great. You got it.  Excuse me.
Oh... God... .
Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
Yeah.
Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
