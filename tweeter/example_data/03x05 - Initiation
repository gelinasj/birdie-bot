Uhhh... nothing.
Yeah, nothing. How was your day?
Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?
I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had s*x. Is that what you want to hear?
Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.
Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.
Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.
 Oh, shhh... Come on.
Uh huh.
 Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
No, I think you're cutting in line.
No, I'm not going to settle down.
Get in the back please.
Boooooo. Thank you. . That's right.
No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.
I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.
Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.
Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
Thank God.
Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
All right! Thank you!
Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?
Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...
Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
And I will be taking questions.
Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!
Hey, what time is it?
AM or PM?
Oh, good.
Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
Yes. Right. Good.
Goodnight!
