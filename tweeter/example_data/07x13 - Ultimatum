January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let's switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let's push through. We'll do this.
Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year's or they break up. Now, if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
 Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not.
Okay, so killing yourself.  I was just thinking about snot.
Happy.
Sad. To soak up my tears.
Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.
Sad, something to break.
For you, job well done.
Both sad.
I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I don't know. "What's your name?" Michael.
Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
So... high five me. We're back. To a happy...  look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.
Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.
Oh my God! That's it! That's it!
Happy! Happy, happy, happy, happy!
I'm trying!
I'm trying!
What?
I'm not listening to music!
Go! Oh, that's nice.
Me? Okay.
I'm good.
Oh my God! 
Hello! Oh, somebody's got a new phone!
That is neat.
 E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
 Why?
 Bummer.
 Reese's Pieces.
I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible. 
Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ?
When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
But you did still love him.
Do you love him now?
No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend.  Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
You think she'd talk to you?
That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out?
Or sooner.
That's not a joke.
Is it?
Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone? Loser.
Just do a cartwheel!
 Eat it.
No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it!
Eat it!
All right, all right, shh!
Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue.  Oh, God! You guys are pathetic.
No! You can't have any candy!
 Holly Flax.
 Not Michael, E.T.
Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there.
Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
It was insensitive and I am sorry.
I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.
You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
Okay, oh! All right.
Okay.
No.
Yup.
You can toss them.
My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.
Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you're going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.
You ready to do this?
You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.
It's about you. It's about you. Go!
You did?
Okay.
Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.
