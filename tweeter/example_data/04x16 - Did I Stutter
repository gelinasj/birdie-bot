Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!
Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...
Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
Here we go!
Let's, yes?
Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it!
It's drying, it's drying...
Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!
Ahh come on!
No!
No!
No!! Come on, gimme something good!
Pam, translate.
I love it!
I love it more!
I... love it!! Haha, come on!
 Hurry, please.
 That's what she said.
Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, "That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole..." I dunno, it's a good feeling.
All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction...
Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
Ener-gize...
Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?
Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
Stanley, we're havin a little...
We're havin a little brainstorm session...
...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.
Ugh, what?
What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
That? In the conference room?
We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did I stutter," and I said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" It was joking, Toby, alright?
Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: "Hey um, you're poor." "Well hey, you're mama's dead." That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.
Mmhmm.
Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...
Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.
I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.
Uh huh...
Great
What's the pink?
Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
Other than me.
I never said you could do that.
I...
Okay, I will think about it.
No.
Hey.
Darryl,  have you ever been in a gang?
It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...
I know, it's very, very personal...
I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
God.
Okay.
Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
What is that?
Really?
I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.
It's like a mock execution.
Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.
No, okay... I've had enough of you.
Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act.  Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?
Stanley Hudson, you are fired.
I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
Hmm.
Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
Okay...
Yes.
That's not-
All right, all right...
Okay.
Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.
Everybody, except Stanley.
 I don't understand why you keep picking on me.
You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.
Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.
All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.
I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield.  What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!
So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?
Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.
