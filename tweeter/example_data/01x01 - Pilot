All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?
All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.
 So that's the way it's done.
I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?
If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. 
Any messages?
Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
People say I am the best boss. They go, "God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious." "And you get the best out of us."  I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.
Whassup!
Whassup!
Whass...up!
 What?
OK. All right. See you later.
Back to work.
Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould.  Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.
Um... Me no get an agenda.
I didn't get any agenda.
Really? I didn't...  Did we get a fax this morning?
Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?
Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.
Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.
OK...
No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
OK. No problem.
Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
Question. How long do we have to...  Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?
Oh, that's not appropriate.
Uh, I don't know what you mean.
Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.  Like that.
Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
Hey.
Guilty! Guilty as charged!
Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! 
Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. 
Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
I'm sorry?
If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. 
I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect.  Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.
People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.
Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
You don't know what it is. 
I don't need your permission.
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
Not gonna happen.
It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
No.
Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.
Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.
Introduce yourself. Be polite.
Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
That's his profit.
OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
What is that?
No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
Discipline. Kinky!  All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.
 Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third.  Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...
Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
Why? Well, theft and stealing.
Post-it Notes.
50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
Yeah. I am.
But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
 Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.
I don't know about that.
What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, "Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.
