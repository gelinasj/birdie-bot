I like it.
I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
And classy, yeah.
 You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
Yes.
He is.
That's what makes him classy.
Strawberries?
Not classy at all.
French. Classy.
 Yes?
Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
Uh-huh.  Here he is.
Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us .  Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
Yes.
What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.
You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go!  Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
Surprise!  As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles.
Took me all night.
I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do.  It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.
All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.
Oh, nerd alert!
This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.
This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange 
There you go! Where's the other?
Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.
Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. 
Oh! Well...
Above and beyond.
That's true.
No. Absolutely not.
Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people.
Well, why don't-
Charles is going to tell you.
Well, it's not official.
Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
Well-
Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen.  He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.
Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.
I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.
 David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.
It was my understanding.
Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
But the branch is still mine?
Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? 
I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before.
Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?
Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.
You're not from paper?
Does David know this?
Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
Whatever David wants.
 Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
No! You idiot! 
Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine.
And I really really need to talk to David.
I was never given a name. 
Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
Nobody thanked me.
For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical.
 Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!
Yep.
Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
Yes it is!
No, it is not.
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
No, seriously.
How old are you?
Five years old?
I'm gonna walk away.
I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
What is that smaller stripper holding?
Ok.
Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.
It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
But it's cool, and it's-
Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
Yeah, why don't you do that?
Yeah, here we go. Ok.
What?
Newsflash: You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace. 
Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? 
 So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
I drove.
Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.
Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
Clearly that's what you wanted.
Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
I've put having a family on hold.
And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you. That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that.
Ok.
 I quit.
You have no idea how high I can fly.
