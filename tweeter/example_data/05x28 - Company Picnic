 Uh oh. What's so funny?
Oh yay! Geography joke.  Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
See you later!
We're just friends.  Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.
All right. Mmhmm.  Hey.
A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
Hey.  Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
Okay.
You can go to hell.  I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: "Holly, you and I are soup snakes." The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.
What is up with you two, Holly?
Cool. For who?
Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported.
All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
You bet your fat ass we are.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
That's right.
Newspapers for sale!
I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
 What?
Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
We could do a movie... sort of thing.
Oh!
Could we get a Delorean?
Oh!  Dun-der. Dun-der...
Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! 
No. No.
We're circling it.
 Uh, it's a sketch now.
And now, presenting...

Yes, I am.
Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
 Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
I'm Robert Mifflin. 
Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
Yes!
I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
David Wallace told me!!
 I guess not.
Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
Thank you.
Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.
Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.
Should've had hindsight.
I think it went well. I think it was good.
No, it was a tough audience.
Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
Me too.  We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
Good to see you.  AJ.
I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.
