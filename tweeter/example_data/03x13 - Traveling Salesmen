Jim, could you come in here please?
Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him.
You know what? Get Pam.
Pam.
Oh, that is gross.
Damn it.
Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.
Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
Oh.
Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.
Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.
Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.
You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.
So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.
Dwight?
Here ya go. 
Please.
Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the "Amazing Race."  And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?
No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
Just bragging rights.
It's just... brrrrrr... It's "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.
Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!
Here we go.
Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
Hawkman.
 Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.
Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?
You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.
You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
No.
Stop it.  Stop it.
Yes.
Ah, no. Don't worry about it.
What?
I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.
Yes, Andy.
He didn't say.
No, you are remembering it wrong.
Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.
I knew it. 
Where were you this morning?
Why do you lie, liar?
You are lying right now.
I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.
Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
Good luck.
