Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today.  Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
Nope. The opposite of that.
Ok, good.
I probably will, why do you ask?
Yeah.
What is your problem?
This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.
Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?
Alright.
Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. 
Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat.  We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.
Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to  Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey  Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.
I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.  OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.
There they are. What's up? Hey hey.
Josh Porter, high five.  Bam.
Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. 
You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
So what's going on? What I miss?
Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... 
Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
Maybe because she's my girlfriend.  Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...
You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,
Yeah, yeah.
Ditto.  How are you Jan?
What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. 
 This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.
Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.

Questions?
Yes, thank you.
Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... 
Oh, ok. Alright.
No you're not.
Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. 
I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. 
I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.
Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. 
Oy vey... schmear.
