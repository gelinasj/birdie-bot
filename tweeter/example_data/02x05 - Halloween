Happy Halloween, everyone!  Oh... that's great!
Ohh... OK.
I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile.  Okay.
Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.
Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.
I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.
Okay... Sherri?
If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
Thanks.
I'll call her back.  Wish I could fire Sherri.
Okay! I'm sorry.
No?
Bye.
I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeeesh.
Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
Because it's very scary stuff.
You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.
No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. 
Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.
Hey.
You guys excited about the party?
It's gonna be fun.
 Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?
Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.
"Bend It Like Beckham."
 Yeah. That would be perfect.
Well, I don't really have two heads. So...
Who do you think it should be?
No, Jim brings in money.
Eh.
It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
 What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
You're right, I didn't even think of him.
Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
Yeah... I could.
I'm not saying that's what he said.
 What?
That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
Are you kidding?
I agree. He'd land on his feet.
So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?
Ahh, come on.
I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... 
Oh, God.
Fantastic!
What?! That would've solved all my problems.
Oh, you idiot.
If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.
Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?
You can call. Can you call 'em?
Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
 Can I speak to you a minute?
Help. Me.
I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.
Yes.
I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.
Yes, that's a good idea.
Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!
I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!
Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
I... this is Creed.
I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. 
And I'm very angry, and I want...
I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.
Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah.
Uh, hey... Creed?
Could I talk to you for a second?
You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.
No, you wanna leave.
Why... why are you making this so hard?
I think you're right.
No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.
Hmm?
What old days? What are you talking about?
It's right here on the desk, yeah.
I can't, I can't...
I can't change anything. This is the way...
I don't... okay, just listen.
Don't...
Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?
I have to fire someone today, okay?
Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
Don't...
Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?
Well, he...
Well, maybe I did.
Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.
No.
No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...
I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
Devon, wait, please.
Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.
I love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.
He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.
You look great! And you're a princess?
A fairy princess. You're very... .
You're a lion.  Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
