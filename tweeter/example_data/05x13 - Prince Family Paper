What you talking bout, Wallace? 
Hi, I am well, how are you?
Oh, have you not?
Yeah.
Okay.
Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?
Oh, well, then, email it to me.
I will seduce her.
No, I will seduce her.
No, I got it.
Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.
Alright, I am a local business owner.  I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies
Michael Scarn.
Okay.
 No.
No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.
Oh, don't start,
You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
You will have pancakes and you'll like it.
So what?
Maybe they are shrinking.
They could be shrinking.
Ah ha  Yup.
Mm hmm .
And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
Argh, why are you all...
Shut up.
Ready to do this?
Good. Here come the sharks. 
In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
Hello.
My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
Thank you.
We are a law firm.
You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question  how many clients do you have?
Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.
Ah, so when did you set up shop?
Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely .
So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
Well that is... because... I am a genius.
Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup?  Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
Try 80.
Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great 
What's going on? Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?
Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?
Excellent! Way to go! Nice! 
Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision.
I... Okay, okay, okay, 
Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
I cannot wait to contact your clients.
Haha, we struck the mother load!
Wallace is going to freak.
He's going to absolutely freak.
Oh shoot.
Oh God, what was that?
Aw, it's alright.
Aw, my car.
No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...
No, no, really not necessary.
You know let me give you some money for this.
Oh coffee, that's too much. 
Thank you.
Ok, goodbye Prince Family.
Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?
Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.
Why don't we just, live and let live?
Live and let live.
It's from James Bond.
I'm not going to make this call.
My heart says...
That is true.
That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
Jan... Ryan.
You're right.
You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
Just something I have to do first.
Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone 
Oh shoot! 
Those people will be ruined. 
Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.
Im not a shark.
 Mpfh.
Thank you.
Okay, bye bye.
I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
Oh, hey what is this?
Oh, she is hot.
