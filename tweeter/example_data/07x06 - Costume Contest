 All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!
A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year!  MACGRUBERRRR!
MACGRUBER!
Oh, here we go!
 OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
Blackula!
Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.
Really? We're good?
Okay.  Okay.
Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.
Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.
You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...
And we are going to straighten this out.
Mmhm!
I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.
No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.
What is taking someone from behind?
It was a good idea, though.
 What the hell are they talking about?
Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?
Oh, you're sorry?
What did you just thought?
All right.
Okay.
Well, don't let it happen again.
I-
Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.
You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
Okay, that might help. If you said "I'm sorry" in front of everybody.
In front of me.
So that's it.
Is it?
Yeah, I gotta get in on this.  Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.
What's a bad idea?
NEVER!  Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.
Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?
If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?
Thank you.
If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!
That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
Oh...
Well...
Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.
You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
I am not budging on the hat issue.
Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.
Sorry I was a jerk.
Friends fight. Friends fight.
