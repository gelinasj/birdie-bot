It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here.
There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody. 
The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...
Oh...
Oh, umm... 
Yes.
AH! Guh-oood.
Please don't do that.
I can't tell you.
I don't have to tell you anything.
Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this.  Brrr! That's strong!
I'm not going get a brain-
Stop it.
Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok? Why don't you just go... away?
There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it--- And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails.
So how do you search?
Try "profits". No! Try "Michael Scott". "Michael" "boss" and "funny".  "Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late." Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers.
Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy! What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot?  I will destroy everything in my path-
Beep! Bop!
Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  Oil can. Oil can.
Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
You know what the problem is?
The problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.
Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be... . No.
There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler.
Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup.
Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them.
Hey there.
Almost quittin' time.
One more hour. Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out.
You have plans.
I do, too. I do, too.
I do, yeah. Big plans.
Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
Yeah.
It's the best. It's the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
It is. Ok.
 What?
Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?
Alright. Oscar, got big plans tonight with-
Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to?
Ok, alright.
Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy. Where you rushin' off to?
Yeah, well duh. Where ya headed?
Liar!
You are a liar.
Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin' tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.
That's, whatever stupid show you want-
To watch tonight
We're watching it.
I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.
You, too, Dwight?
 Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.
 Boom! Detective Michael Scarn. I'm with the FBI.
Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life? Somebody has a gun.  That's why I always start with a gun, because you can't top it, you just can't.
Boom! Freeze! Michael Scoon, FBI. You know what you did. Boom! Boom! Boom!  Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
Why
Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.
Boring.
I could of-
Ok.
Yehhhehh.
I'm in.
No, no, no. I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
What are you... 
Nothing.
Good, it's good. Good work, everybody.
So Bernie's, huh? We're all going to Bernie's?  Go to Bernie's?
Right, right, right. Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party. A big office party I need to go to, so... Can't get out of it.
Ok, see you later. Nice job, Bill. Not.
Wow! Who opened the morgue for this thing? I'm just driving by, thought I'd drop in.  Oh, come on! That guy? He is a good guy, not a terrorist. Karaoke, I love it! I am a karaoke fiend. I call dibs. I got next, I got next up. Come on, let's get this party started, ha! Ok? Where's that wine?
Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please.  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin' on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on. Tender love is blind---
We're making love!
Talk! Just talk!
Shut up!
Funny story And that was an improv. Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.
