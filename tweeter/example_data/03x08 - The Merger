Here... Who's here?
Yes, please.
Karen Filip...  Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
Okay.
My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. 
Who's next?
Andy Bernard.
Saint Bernard.
What?
I'm not...
I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.
Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So... As far as I'm concerned,  this says 'World's Best Dad'.
Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?
Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you.  Okay.
Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton.  All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
Welcome.
Welcome, welcome, welcome!  Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?
Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
Oh.
They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.
You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
 No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
 How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work.  Not... so, your desk is...
Right.
 I present the orientation video.
Not now.
I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
Work it out amongst your selves!
Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
Will you?
Please?
Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!
Yoko shack.
Nope, no. Guests only.
Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please.  Welcome. Help yourself.
Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".
Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.
So check out how we live
They call it Scranton.
The Electric City. Scranton.
The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
 I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.
You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
 Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.
Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
All right.
Okay.
What is that? A squid's eye or...
How did you...
People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.
I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
Ssshh stupid! Um...
That's it!
Yes, yes! Okay!
Okay, here we go.
Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Scuse me! Scuse me!
You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
 Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
Okay! Okay!
All right, all right, I'm on a roll.
Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
I understand. We're all friends.
Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
You know what? I'll help. I will...
Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.
We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
I'm right in your crack!
Up and over.
Up and over.
You've got it.
You've got it, you've got it.
Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
Easy.
Don't...
What...
I don't understand.
Well, we'll squeeze you in.
You can't quit! On the first day. That's  Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?
My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?
Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.
You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
Yeah.
Go home, Toby. Just...
Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful.  "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"
No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...
THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most.  Jell-o!
Hi, Jan!
I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
Yes.
But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
What?
Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.
So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
Uh... that I have not decided yet.
Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.
Shut it...
Shut it! That's...  suck up!
