 Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude.
Yes?
Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.
 Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay?  Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
...in order to feed the bears.
How do you mean?
Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
Okay.
Hm?
Well I have interviews.
Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
Oh you don't, that's-
That sounds good. Thank you.
Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck.
 There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
Mmm!
You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.
Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
What do you like Pam?
What kind of toppings would you like?
Sounds good. Fudge it up! 
 I still need something to drink out of though.
 Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.
When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute.  And she still is.
Ahh.

Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt.  May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. 
But you're the best salesman, on the inside.
You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
You're not gonna lose them.
Just do your best! I have faith in you.
Kevin, I have something for you.
You know who that is?
 Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
Good, stand up.  You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
You will find love.
Don't be. You should never settle for who you are.  Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-

 He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have s*x at some point?
How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
Mmhmm, bravo!
Sure!
Who's that? Who's that guy? 
I guess this could be the one, huh?
My last pay check?
No.
I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?
Nah, I'm almost done.
Yeah.

Hi. What is the name of our town?
No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
 Yes my hero!
 Ohh, I miss you.
Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
 And I have said goodbye to half of them.
 Okay.
 Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?
 She was once my girl, and she is your girl now.
Yeah.
You're not prone to seizures?
 Um, Pam.

 Darryl!
I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage.  Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.
Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.
No problem. Worth a try.
 Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.


Kevin?
Ahhhh...
Maybe neither.
Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart.  And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
N-
Okay. 
Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. 
So I wanted to give you that. 

You should see the other guy.
 Jim where is Pam?
But it is already three o'clock! 
 Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.
Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
 And you, why are you still here.
No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? 

What is this meeting about?
Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam.  And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.
 Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
Umm, hmm?
 I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!
Sure.  Be right out!
 Ohh...
 Okay...
Maybe.
Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
 You started with this company, as a fine young man...
Oh, okay.
 Oh shoot! That's my cab.
Alright.
I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?
I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
Okay...  Phyllis.
No no no, let me see. 
Later guys. 
Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now.  I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
