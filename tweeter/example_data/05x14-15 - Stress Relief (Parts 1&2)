Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm.
Stay  calm!
Everyone, now  calm down!
What does warm mean?
Don't run.
Get out of the way! Go, go, go!
Okay, we're trapped. Everyone for himself.
 Help!! Help!!
No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president! You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.
He's going to swallow is tongue.
Open your mouth. Come on. Don't swallow it.
Leave me al--
Saving him!
Electricity.
Hed. Hedded
Take hedded of.
Heed. Heed.
Take heed of.
Take heed of.
Okay.  This city. Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.
Yes. We are. We are livid. But we are going to let this one slide.
I am not a mind reader, David.
And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that Dwight doesn't like.
Do you?
You talking to me?
What?
 No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands.
Yeah.
That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.
Yes.
I'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out.
No, I will.
Nobody should have to go to work thinking, "Oh, this is the place that I might die today." That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying. An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true.
Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable.  Welcome back, Stanley.
Andy.
No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means "always be closing."
Shut it. Shut it.
We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do. So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.
You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
Come on.
No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working. What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
And you're okay with that?
Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on. Get up. Let's do this.
Come on Stanley. You're losing you. You're losing you. Do it!
This is you we're talking about.
Okay, okay. I'll show them. Here we go.  Stanley. All right.
No, Rose. They are not breathing. And they have no arms or legs.
Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.
okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour?
I will divide and then count to it.
Yes, yes I do. I love that song.  First I was afraid, I was petrified.
Okay, I got it.
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive  Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...
He is an organ donor.
Yeah.
Hey, Stanley.
Are you okay?
Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
Hi, everyone. Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
Let's hear it.
 Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...
My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds.  That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...
 It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.
Too expensive.
Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want?  What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
You have stress?
During our relaxation exercise?
No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.
Let me getcha.
Ok, alright.
Ok. 
Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay?  Let's give this a shot.
Hellloo... 
So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.
I don't get it. Do I stress you out?
Oh...
Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think.  You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...
What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other...
Si senor.
It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.
I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.
Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.  Ok... lower the mic for the midget.
Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
You're so lucky! Good one... 
Well...
Pow pow pow... 

I know where this is goin'.
No...
No.
Spite her - ok 
Oh, stop it Dwight.
No no no no no no!
Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot.
Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
Idiot.
Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
We are, we are a family.
Oh very funny.
Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?
I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
Jefferson.
Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. 
 Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...
You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face.  I'm okay. No, I'm not.
I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela?  Oscar, you're gay.
Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. 
They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto them pills, just in case.
