Oh, yeah. 
It's from "Sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me. 
Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre.  They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses. Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses.
Oh!  For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.
Cool. What next? 
Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control -
Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened...
And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
And - 
Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please. 
 Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?
Why do I have to explain everything?
Okay. 
Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is.  You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.
You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?
Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert.
In training.
We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?
We have a little song prepared for you.
Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.
Saber.
Wow. Really terrific.
Perfect.
No. Don't like that.
Mm, nope. Don't like that.
We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?
I don't know what they're made of.
You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba -
 Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach?
What?
I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us.
Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em.
All of them.
So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.
Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -
Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do.
I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.
I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre.  Hey. Hi, sorry.
I hope you're not busy doing something.
You sure?
You look great too.
Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
Hey. Wow.
Really loud.
Wow. Oh, yummy.  You have got the life, my friend.
Can I just stay here and never go back?
Oh, man. How much time do you have?
Yeah.
Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...
I don't know.
Sabre is changing everything.  Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?
Exactly. What are you thinking?
It is a tough one.
Yeah. But one would be good.
Okay.
Okay.
So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
Oh, okay.
No, I think it is-
Yep.
The what?
Oh, okay.
Like it.
There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em.
See you later. 
Bye now.
Thanks for having me.
Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember.  That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.
Hello.  Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.
You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.
Well, I'm not really one for making speeches.
But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.
Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.
