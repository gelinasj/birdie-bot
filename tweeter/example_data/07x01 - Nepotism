I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception.' Or at least I dreamt I did.
He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though.  Ah! It's not cappuccino.
It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?
Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.
And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.
Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a- 14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.
Don't bother Luke.
That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?
No, it... Yes, okay, right. 
Come on. Okay, um...  That's as clear as I can make it.
Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew.
Luke is my nephew.
Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.
Thank you.
No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?
Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "Wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "Well, it's in the genes." And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!
All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.
I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.
Wait a minute.
Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony.
No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit.
Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
You don't have all the facts.
I love him.
No. No. He's my nephew.
Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.
I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other.
Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no!  Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!
Give me the pointer.
No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.
Okay.
All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-
Okay, can I have that?
Ok, I am going to count down from five.
I'm not kidding.
Give-okay. Alright, give it up.
 You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
That's what you're going to do, Luke!
I had to do that.
All right. Are we good?  You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?
Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them.
That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.
I can do that.
Okay. Wait, what?
Is there another option?
