Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.
Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  ... ha ha ha.
I am going to scare these kids so bad.
Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?
Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
Who wants candy?
...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival.
Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
They have a TCBY booth.
The same stuff you get downtown.
Do you like TCBY?
I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh... it'll be fun
You should give them a call. Check that out.
Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
Wha- what?
Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand.
I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.
Let me get your stroller.
What are you gonna call him?
No. What is his name?
Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal.
Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?
...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
They are into style.
They are into appearance. We are selling success.
That's sorta secondary. 
Alright. Hi. Any messages?
Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.
It rained.
Nothing. Cocoa.
Good. Yep.
Ok. Thank you.
 Yeah?
Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?
Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
Not yet!
No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. 
Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
Oh. He did? What did he say?
Ok.
Thank you, Stanley.
Ok.
Yes.
I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.
I know what a flounder is.
I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good.
The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?
Uh...
You never said anything.
Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!'
We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right?  Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
Your nose?
Alright.
No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.
Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah?  Meredith?
Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
Ok.
It's a fish.
It could've died of natural causes. So...
Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?
What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
No, no.
No. We are not done here. This-
No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.
Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
I want to make fun of you right now.
No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.
Oh, my God.
Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much?  Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.
Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.
It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing.  Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.
Is this the tape of me falling?
No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.
It's alright. I can handle it.
I am a grown-up, Jim.
I don't think you froze.
Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
Oscar's a douche.
No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok. 
You're welcome. Whoa!
